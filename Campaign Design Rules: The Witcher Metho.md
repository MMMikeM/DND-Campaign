Campaign Design Rules: The Witcher Method
Rule 1: Personal Stakes Above Political Landscapes

Core principle: Create at least one NPC the players deeply care about who needs their help
Implementation:

Introduce this character early and develop connection before major threats arise
Make this person competent but still vulnerable (not just a helpless damsel)
Establish familial or mentor-like bonds that transcend regular alliances
The character's fate should matter more than any regional politics


Decision test: Would players sacrifice political advantage to protect this person?

Rule 2: Morally Gray Choices Without Clear Answers

Core principle: No perfect solutions to significant problems
Implementation:

Every major decision should have legitimate pros and cons
Always involve costs/sacrifices with each potential path
Include reasonable people on multiple sides of conflicts
Create situations where "good" choices have harmful consequences


Decision test: Would reasonable players disagree about the right choice?

Rule 3: Consequences Ripple Beyond Intentions

Core principle: Actions have unexpected impacts that manifest later
Implementation:

Track player decisions and incorporate consequences 3-10 sessions later
Ensure some outcomes cannot be predicted at decision time
Create cascade effects where one decision influences unforeseen situations
Balance positive and negative unexpected outcomes


Decision test: Will players be surprised but recognize the connection to past choices?

Rule 4: Varied Opposition with Depth

Core principle: Create a spectrum of antagonists from understandable to truly malevolent

Implementation:
- Include some villains with sympathetic or understandable motivations
- Incorporate others who embody genuine malevolence or corruption
- Develop antagonists with varying degrees of redemption potential
- Show how ideology, circumstance, or nature can create different types of evil
- Ensure even the most malevolent villains have consistent internal logic

Decision test: Does each antagonist feel authentic to their nature rather than a generic "bad guy"?

Rule 5: Local Stories Reveal Global Stakes

Core principle: Experience world-threatening issues through personal narratives
Implementation:

Show global threats through effects on specific communities and individuals
Use small-scale quests to foreshadow larger dangers
Make abstract threats concrete through personal stories
Connect side quests thematically to main storylines


Decision test: Do small stories help players understand the big picture?

Rule 6: Competing Goods, Not Just Fighting Evil

Core principle: Conflict often emerges between different positive values
Implementation:

Frame major conflicts as justice vs. mercy, tradition vs. progress, etc.
Create situations where players must prioritize one value over another
Avoid obvious "good vs. evil" framing for major storylines
Design scenarios where players must choose what's worth sacrificing


Decision test: Would players feel conflicted regardless of their choice?

Rule 7: Investment Before Crisis

Core principle: Build emotional connection before introducing major threats
Implementation:

First sessions focus on relationship building, not world-saving
Give players time to care about locations before threatening them
Establish NPC relationships in peaceful moments before testing them
Create opportunities for shared history between PCs and important NPCs


Decision test: Would players take risks for this NPC/location without quest rewards?

Rule 8: Faction Complexity Beyond Alignment

Core principle: Organizations have internal conflicts and mixed motivations
Implementation:

Design factions with competing internal priorities and perspectives
Include admirable individuals in problematic groups (and vice versa)
Create situations where factions act against their usual patterns
Allow players to influence faction direction, not just support or oppose


Decision test: Can players identify with aspects of multiple competing factions?

Rule 9: The Lesser Evil Is Still Evil

Core principle: Victory often comes with genuine costs and compromises
Implementation:

Ensure "best" outcomes still involve legitimate downsides
Create situations where morally questionable means may be necessary
Force players to confront the consequences of pragmatic choices
Design genuinely difficult ethical dilemmas with lasting impact


Decision test: Would players feel uneasy even after making the "right" choice?

Rule 10: The Personal Connection Trumps All

Core principle: Emotional bonds outweigh political or practical considerations
Implementation:

Create scenarios testing loyalty to loved ones vs. "greater good"
Design quests where personal vendettas/connections complicate objectives
Allow strong relationships to transcend faction boundaries
Make pursuit/protection of loved ones drive the central narrative


Decision test: Would players risk the mission to save someone they care about?
