# Mike's TTRPGRules

## **2. Spell Points (SP)**

Magic is fueled by **Spell Points (SP)**, representing a caster's pool of magical energy. Activating Spell **Modes** and adding **Enhancements** costs SP.

### **2.1 Gaining and Spending SP**

- **SP Pool:** You have a maximum number of SP based on your character level, as shown on Table 2-1. You regain all expended SP after completing a **Long Rest**.
- **Spending SP:** When you activate a Spell using one of its **Modes** (other than the 0 SP Basic Effect) or add **Enhancements**, you spend SP equal to the total cost. You cannot spend more SP than you currently have.

### **2.2 Basic Effects (0 SP)**

Each core Spell has a **Basic Effect** listed in Section 3.4 that costs 0 SP to use. These represent minor manifestations of the Spell's concept and can be used at will, serving as a viable alternative combat action or cantrip-level utility.

### **2.3 Maximum SP per Activation**

There is a limit to the total SP you can spend on a single activation of a Spell (Base Mode Cost + Enhancement Costs). This limit prevents characters from expending their entire energy pool on one overwhelmingly powerful effect early on. This limit is based on your character level, as shown on Table 2-1.

### **2.4 Spell Point Progression**

#### Table 2-1: Spell Points and Maximum SP per Activation by Level**

## 3. Spells

### ### **3.1 Nature of Spells**

In this system, specific spell lists are replaced by **Spells**. Spells are the fundamental building blocks of magical effects â€“ generic templates representing a core concept like projecting energy, healing wounds, or bolstering defenses. Unlike the vast and highly specific spell lists of standard 5th Edition, this system uses a smaller, curated list of core Spells.

The specific manifestation, damage type, and finer details of a Spell activated by a caster are determined by the **Essences** they apply (detailed in Section 4), while the overall potency and additional effects are modified by **Enhancements** (detailed in Section 5).

This approach shifts the focus from memorizing hundreds of specific incantations to understanding a core set of effects and creatively applying Essences and Enhancements using your Spell Points (SP).

### **3.2 Learning Spells**

Characters do not prepare spells daily. Instead, they **know** a set number of Spells, representing the magical effects they have mastered.

- **Spells Known:** Your class determines the number of Spells you know. You start knowing a certain number of Spells at 1st level (or when you gain access to Spells) and learn additional Spells as you gain levels. The specific progression is detailed in the class description (Section 7) or accompanying tables.
- **Choosing Spells:** When a feature states you learn a Spell, you choose a new Spell from your **Class Spell List**. Spells themselves generally do not have inherent level requirements beyond being available on your class list; access is determined by the number of Spells your class level grants you. Potency is governed by SP cost and the Maximum SP per Activation limit (Section 2.3).
- **Changing Known Spells:** When you gain a level in a class that grants access to Spells, you can typically choose one of the Spells you know and replace it with another Spell from your Class Spell List.
- **Learning Outside Lists:** Some class features might grant the ability to learn Spells from lists other than your primary Class Spell List.

### **3.3 Spell Descriptions**

Each Spell is presented in a standard format, detailing its core function before any Enhancements are applied.

- **Name:** A generic name representing the Spell's core concept.
- **Base SP Cost:** The minimum Spell Points required to activate the core effect.
- **Casting Time:** The action required (e.g., 1 Action, Reaction).
- **Range:** The maximum distance (e.g., Self, Touch, 30 feet).
- **Components:** Specifies necessary components. **By default, all Spells require V (Verbal) and M (Focus)**, where the Focus replaces non-costly material components.
  - Costly material components are listed explicitly after the M (Focus) entry (e.g., "M (Focus, and a diamond worth 500 gp, which the Spell consumes)").
  - **S (Somatic)** is listed *only if* intricate gestures are required *in addition* to manipulating the focus. If S is not listed, only verbalization and handling the focus are needed.
- **Duration:** How long the effect lasts (e.g., Instantaneous, Concentration up to 1 minute).
- **Core Effect:** Description of the fundamental result of activating the Spell at its Base SP Cost. Details targets, saving throws, damage/healing, conditions, etc. Damage type is determined by Essences.
- **Tags:** Optional keywords:
  - **Concentration:** Requires concentration following standard 5e rules.
  - **Ritual:** Can optionally be cast over 10 minutes longer without spending SP.

### **3.4 Core Spells**

This section details the baseline **Basic Effect (0 SP)** for each core Spell. This effect can be used at will without spending Spell Points and is intended as a **viable alternative combat action** compared to a standard weapon attack or cantrip. Spending **Spell Points (SP)** allows activating one of the spell's specific **Modes** (detailed in Section 5), which replaces the Basic Effect and unlocks further customization through **Enhancements**.

Default V (Verbal) and M (Focus) components are assumed unless S (Somatic) or costly M components are also required. If only simple verbalization and focus manipulation are needed, no component is listed beyond the default V/M. Damage types are determined by Essence. Durations listed for Basic Effects do not require Concentration unless specified.

## 4: Essences

### **4.1 Defining Essences**

**Essences** are the essential flavor and specific manifestation applied to a generic **Spell** when it is activated. They are the difference between a generic *Bolt* Spell and a scorching *Fire Bolt*, a crackling *Lightning Bolt*, or a debilitating *Necrotic Ray*. Essences bridge the gap between the abstract mechanical framework of a Spell and the evocative, descriptive magic seen in play. They provide:

- **Sensory Description:** How the Spell looks, sounds, smells, feels.
- **Thematic Grounding:** Connects the Spell to the caster's style (arcane formulas, divine prayers, primal calls, psionic focus).
- **Mechanical Hooks:** Determines damage type and provides links for potential status effects via **Enhancements**.

### **4.2 Choosing Essences**

Characters learn Essences based primarily on their chosen magical path and training.

- **Learning Essence Descriptors:** When a character first gains access to **Spells** (typically at 1st level or through multiclassing), they choose **two Essence Descriptors** (from the list in 4.5) that fit their character concept, subject to GM approval. Additional Descriptors might be learned through class features, feats, or specific training during downtime (GM permitting).
- **Descriptor Knowledge:** Knowing an Essence Descriptor (e.g., "Fire") means you can apply its theme, associated damage type, and minor effects to any Spell you activate where it makes narrative sense.

### **4.3 Applying Essences**

When activating a **Spell**, the caster chooses **one** known **Essence Descriptor** to apply. This choice primarily dictates the Spell's sensory details and damage type.

- **Flavor First:** The primary role of applying an Essence is descriptive. It determines *how* the Spell manifests. For example, applying a "Fire" Essence to the *Heal* Spell wouldn't cause burning damage; instead, it might manifest as warm, soothing flames that knit wounds closed, or a comforting heat that revitalizes the target. The Spell's core mechanical function (restoring Hit Points) remains unchanged.
- **Narrative Consistency:** While flexible, the chosen Essence should generally align with the Spell's intended effect. Applying an Essence whose fundamental nature contradicts the Spell's core function usually doesn't make sense. For example, describing a *Heal* Spell using the "Necrotic" Essence (associated with decay and undeath) would likely be inappropriate for restoring life energy to a living creature. The GM helps ensure descriptions remain coherent within the established fiction.
- **No Base Cost:** Applying a basic Essence Descriptor does not increase the **SP** cost of activating the Spell.

---

## Updated Rules Text (Sections 4.4 - 4.6)

### **4.4 Mechanical Impact of Essences**

While primarily descriptive, Essences have key mechanical implications:

- **Damage Type:** For Spells that deal damage, the chosen Essence Descriptor *becomes* the damage type (e.g., Fire damage, Cold damage, Life damage, Necrotic damage). Resistance and vulnerability function based on these Essence types. *(Optional Rule: For tables preferring standard 5e damage types, a mapping can be used where each Essence corresponds to a similar 5e type, like Life -> Radiant, Earth -> Bludgeoning, etc. This should be decided at the campaign start.*
- **Status Effect Association:** Base Essences do not automatically impose conditions. However, each Essence Descriptor is linked to a specific **composite status effect** (detailed in 4.5). These associations serve as hooks for **Enhancements** (Section 5), which may allow a caster to spend additional **SP** (typically +2 SP) to add the Essence's associated status effect to a Spell.
- **Minor Inherent Effects:** Essences provide minor, flavorful, non-combat effects related to their nature (e.g., Fire can ignite flammable objects, Cold can chill surfaces, Thunder is loud, Light illuminates). These should be used for descriptive color and minor narrative advantages, not significant mechanical benefits without specific **Enhancements**.
- **Skill Interactions:** The description of an Essence might occasionally grant circumstantial benefits relevant to skills (e.g., an *Illusion* Spell with a convincing "Shadow" Essence might aid Stealth). This is situational and adjudicated by the GM.
- **Component Interaction:** The default Verbal (V) and Focus (M) components required for Spells are generally unchanged by Essences.

---

### **4.5 Essence Descriptors**

These represent fundamental energy or substance types used to shape magical effects. Damage dealt by Spells uses the name of the applied Essence as its type (unless using the optional 5e mapping). Each is linked to a specific **composite status effect**, detailed below. Enhancements may allow applying these effects (typically requiring a saving throw from the target). Unless otherwise noted, an effect imposed by an Enhancement lasts until the start of the caster's next turn or requires Concentration as specified by the Enhancement. *Apply ONE Essence each time you cast a spell.  The Essence decides the spellâ€™s damage type **and** inflicts the status shown below when you use a Statusâ€‘granting Enhancement.*

| # | Essence  | Status Name | What happens to the target? *(all last until start of your next turn unless noted)* |
|---|----------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | **Fire** | **Ignited** | â€¢Â Disadvantage on all attack rolls  âŸ¡Â Takes **double damage from Cold**  âŸ¡Â Glows faintly (sheds dim light) |
| 2 | **Cold** | **Frozen** | â€¢Â Speed drops to **5Â ft**  âŸ¡Â Takes **double damage from Fire**  âŸ¡Â Disadvantage on **Athletics** checks |
| 3 | **Life** | **Overgrown** | â€¢Â Speed drops to **5Â ft**  âŸ¡Â Attacks **against** the target have **advantage**  âŸ¡Â Disadvantage on grapple/disarm attempts |
| 4 | **Necrotic** | **Withered** | â€¢Â Disadvantage on all attack rolls  âŸ¡Â Disadvantage on **Constitution saves**  âŸ¡Â Disadvantage on **Strength** checks |
| 5 | **Light** | **Dazzled** | â€¢Â Disadvantage on all attack rolls  âŸ¡Â Disadvantage on **Wisdom saves**  âŸ¡Â Cannot benefit from half or threeâ€‘quarters cover vs you |
| 6 | **Shadow** | **Shrouded** | â€¢Â Armor ClassÂ âˆ’2  âŸ¡Â Takes **extra damageÂ =Â yourÂ SpellÂ Mod** the **first time** it is hit each turn  âŸ¡Â Disadvantage on sightâ€‘based **Perception** |
| 7 | **Lightning** | **Conductive** | â€¢Â Disadvantage on all attack rolls  âŸ¡Â Takes **extra damageÂ =Â yourÂ SpellÂ Mod** the **first time** it is hit each turn  âŸ¡Â Disadvantage on **Dexterity** checks |
| 8 | **Earth** | **Weighted** | â€¢Â Armor ClassÂ âˆ’2  âŸ¡Â Takes **extra damageÂ =Â yourÂ SpellÂ Mod** the **first time** it is hit each turn  âŸ¡Â Disadvantage on grapple/disarm attempts |
| 9 | **Psychic** | **Scrambled** | â€¢Â Disadvantage on **all saving throws**  âŸ¡Â SpeedÂ âˆ’10Â ft & disadvantage vs being pushed or knocked prone  âŸ¡Â Disadvantage on **Insight** checks |
|10 | **Force** | **Unstable** | â€¢Â Armor ClassÂ âˆ’2  âŸ¡Â Attacks **against** the target have **advantage**  âŸ¡Â When pushed or pulled, it moves **+5Â ft** farther |
|11 | **Sound** | **Deafened** | â€¢Â Disadvantage on **all saving throws**  âŸ¡Â Attacks **against** the target have **advantage**  âŸ¡Â Must pass **DCÂ 10Â Con** check to cast spells with a verbal component |
|12 | **Toxic** | **Enfeebled** | â€¢Â Disadvantage on all attack rolls  âŸ¡Â Disadvantage on **Constitution saves**  âŸ¡Â Disadvantage on **Constitution** checks |

## Section 5: Enhancements

### **5.1 Purpose of Enhancements**

**Enhancements** allow casters to spend **Spell Points (SP)** to augment the **Basic Effect (0 SP)** of their known Spells. The most fundamental Enhancement is the **Standard Activation Enhancement**, which unlocks the Spell's original core function at a specific SP cost. Further Enhancements allow casters to scale a Spell's effects (increasing potency, scope, or duration), add new functions, or even alter how the Spell is cast or resolved, typically building upon the Standard Activation.

### **5.2 Learning and Using Enhancements**

- **Learning Enhancements:** Characters typically learn Enhancements as they gain levels in their spellcasting class, often choosing **one specific Spell** they know and **one Enhancement Category** relevant to that Spell.
- **Define the Benefit:** Working with the GM, the player defines the specific mechanical benefit and **SP** cost for the learned Enhancement. They can either:
  - Choose a suggested Example benefit from the list in 5.4 for the chosen Spell and Category.
  - Propose a custom benefit that fits the chosen Category, using the Examples as guidelines for balance and scope (GM approval required).
  - The player should clearly record the defined benefit and its associated SP cost. This becomes *their* unique, learned Enhancement for that Spell.
- **Applying Enhancements:** When activating a Spell, the caster declares they are using one or more learned Enhancements for that Spell. They describe the enhanced effect and add the SP cost of all applied Enhancements to the Spell's Base SP Cost. The total SP spent cannot exceed the Maximum SP per Activation limit (see 5.3).
- **Combining Enhancements:** Multiple *different* learned Enhancements can be applied to a single Spell activation, provided their effects are not contradictory (e.g., you cannot apply two Enhancements that change the saving throw type to different stats). The SP costs are cumulative.

### **5.3 Maximum SP per Activation**

To maintain balance across levels, there is a limit to the total number of **Spell Points (SP)** (Base SP Cost + Enhancement SP Costs) that can be spent on a single activation of any Spell. This limit typically increases as a character gains levels. The specific progression will be detailed on [Table X-Y: Maximum SP per Activation] (to be created later, likely tied to class progression or caster level).

6.7 Final Details: Alignment, personality traits, appearance, name, etc.

## **7. Classes**

This section details the core classes available in Mike's TTRPG Rules. Each class is tied to one of the six core ability scores and provides a unique thematic and mechanical framework. Your class determines your starting hit points, proficiencies, class features gained at higher levels, and your access to **Spells**.

### **7.1 Gaining Class Features**

As you gain levels in a class, you will unlock new features, including potentially more **Spells Known**. Your **Spell Point (SP)** pool and **Maximum SP per Activation** limit increase automatically with your character level as shown on **Table 2-1** (unless a specific class feature states otherwise, though this is uncommon).

### **7.2 Starting Spells**

At 1st level (or when you first gain access to Spells through your class), you **know** a total of **four Spells**. The specific spells are determined as follows:

1. **Core Attack Spell:** Your class grants you knowledge of either `Strike` or `Bolt`, or allows you to choose one of them.
2. **Unique Thematic Spell:** Your class grants you knowledge of a specific mandatory Spell that embodies its core concept.
3. **Choice Spells (Choose 2):** You choose two additional Spells from your class's specific **Available Spells** list.

    - Zone`

#### **7.3.2 Trickster (Dexterity)**

- **Core Ability:** Dexterity
- **Concept:** Tricksters excel through speed, precision, and cunning, their enhanced agility allowing them to **Move** (`Move`) with supernatural grace. They might use magically guided attacks (`Strike`/`Bolt`), misdirection (`Illusion`), or sheer nimbleness to confound foes and navigate danger. This is just a template; your Trickster's style is yours to define.
- **What could your Trickster be?**
  - A shadow dancer who blinks short distances between attacks.
  - A seemingly luck-touched gambler whose throws always hit their mark.
  - A battlefield acrobat whose dazzling movements confound opponents.
  - A silent hunter who seems to glide through any environment unseen.
- **How does your dexterity express itself?** Is it subtle and secretive, focused on remaining unseen? Flamboyant and showy, drawing attention while setting up a ruse? Methodical and precise, exploiting every small advantage?
- **Hit Dice:** 1d8 per Trickster level
- **Proficiencies:**
  - **Armor:** Light armor
  - **Weapons:** Simple weapons, hand crossbows, longswords, rapiers, shortswords, shortbows
