## 3. Classes: The Heart of Your Hero

Your class represents not merely what your character does, but *how* they channel magical power and approach challenges. Each class is a flexible framework aligned with one of the six core ability scores, celebrating your natural strengths while leaving ample room for your unique interpretive flair.

### **3.1 Starting Spells**

At 1st level, you begin with **four foundational spells** that form the bedrock of your magical repertoire:

1. **Core Attack Spell:** Your primary magical offensive option—either `Strike` (melee), `Bolt` (ranged), or a choice between them, depending on your class
2. **Unique Spell:** A distinctive magical ability that only your class can access, representing its fundamental approach to magic
3. **Choice Spells:** Two additional spells you select from your class's available options, allowing you to customize your initial capabilities

> **Magical Foundation Tip:** When selecting your choice spells, consider balancing offense, defense, and utility. Even combat-focused characters benefit from having at least one non-combat option in their initial spell selection.

### **3.2 The Six Classes**

#### **3.2.1 Champion**

> *Force of will made manifest*

Key Ability: **Strength**

Champions transform raw physical power into tangible magical effects. Their might isn't just muscle—it's an extension of an unbreakable will that both protects allies and devastates enemies. Whether manifesting as shimmering barriers, earthen walls that rise at a stomp, or strikes that channel supernatural force, a Champion's magic is physical prowess incarnate.

**The Champion's Power:** Their unique spell, `Barrier`, creates physical manifestations of their protective instinct. Combined with their enhanced `Strike`, Champions excel at controlling the battlefield while dealing significant damage.

> **Champion in Action:** Thorne slams his greataxe into the ground, channeling earth essence through his weapon. "Stand behind me!" he commands as a wall of jagged stone erupts in a protective semicircle, buying his companions precious moments to regroup as the goblin horde crashes against his newly-formed bulwark.

#### **3.2.3 Adapter**

> *Evolution incarnate*

Key Ability: **Constitution**

Adapters draw power from their remarkable resilience, channeling their life force into extraordinary transformations. Their bodies become both weapon and shield, changing to meet any challenge.

> **Adapter in Action:** Cornered by the patrol, Kira closes her eyes and takes a deep breath. When she opens them again, her skin has taken on the mottled gray of stone, her hands have transformed into jagged claws, and her senses have sharpened to predatory acuity. "You really don't want this fight," she growls, her voice now carrying a primal edge that makes even the veteran guards hesitate.

| Aspect            | Details                                                   |

Key Ability: **Intelligence**

Scholars bend reality through careful study, pattern recognition, and the precise application of knowledge.

With careful gestures, she rearranges the tumblers telekinetically, bypassing the trap that would have triggered had anyone touched it physically.

| Aspect            | Details                                                            |

#### **3.2.5 Sage**

> *Perceiving what others cannot*

Key Ability: **Wisdom**

Sages draw power from perception, intuition, and a deep connection to the world around them. They see truths hidden from others, whether through communion with spirits, reading auras, or an uncanny understanding of patterns and motivations.

**The Sage's Insight:** Their unique spell, `Arcane Sight`, represents their extraordinary perception. Combined with their flexible choice of attack spell and supportive abilities, Sages excel at guidance, healing, protection, and understanding deeper patterns in the world.

> **Sage in Action:** As the party debates their next move, Orrin closes his eyes and extends his awareness beyond physical sight.

"There's a presence here that doesn't belong to this time... and it's watching us right now."

| Aspect            | Details                                                      |

### **3.3 Class Selection Strategy**

When choosing your class, consider both mechanical fit and narrative satisfaction:

**Mechanical Considerations:**

* Does the class's Key Ability align with where you placed your highest modifier?
* Does the play style (front-line fighter, mobile striker, support caster) match your preferences?
* Are you drawn to the unique spell and available spell options?

**Narrative Considerations:**

* Does the class's thematic approach to magic resonate with your character concept?
* Can you envision exciting stories emerging from your class's approach to challenges?
* Does the class provide a framework that feels both inspiring and flexible?

Remember that your class is a starting point, not a rigid limitation. As you gain Enhancements and develop your character, you'll customize your abilities far beyond the baseline class framework. The most compelling heroes often develop in surprising ways that transcend simple class definitions.
