## **3. Classes**

This section details the core classes available in Mike's TTRPG Rules. Each class is tied to one of the six core ability scores and provides a unique and mechanical framework. Your class determines your starting hit points, proficiencies, class features gained at higher levels, and your access to **Spells**.

### **3.1 Gaining Class Features**

As you gain levels in a class, you will unlock new features, including potentially more **Spells Known**. Your **Spell Point (SP)** pool and **Maximum SP per Activation** limit increase automatically with your character level as shown on **Table 2-1** (unless a specific class feature states otherwise, though this is uncommon).

### **3.2 Starting Spells**

At 1st level (or when you first gain access to Spells through your class), you **know** a total of **four Spells**. The specific spells are determined as follows:

1. **Core Attack Spell:** Your class grants you knowledge of either `Strike` or `Bolt`, or allows you to choose one of them.
2. **Unique Spell:** Your class grants you knowledge of a specific mandatory Spell that embodies its core concept.
3. **Choice Spells (Choose 2):** You choose two additional Spells from your class's specific **Available Spells** list.

### **3.3 Class Descriptions**

The following classes represent broad archetypes defined by their primary ability score. Each description offers a theme and typical expressions of power, but these are merely suggestions – a foundation upon which to build *your* unique character. Use your choice of **Spells**, **Essences**, and **Enhancements** to bring your specific concept to life. How your character embodies their class is entirely up to you.

You are absolutely right! My apologies, I trimmed those flavorful examples too aggressively when converting to the table format. Let me add those back in.

Here are the updated class entries with the "What could your X be?" bullet points restored:

#### **3.3.1 Champion (Strength)**

Champions harness raw physical power, translating overwhelming Strength into tangible magical effects. They dominate the battlefield through might, protect allies with unwavering resolve, and their force of will can manifest as physical **Barriers** (`Barrier`) just as readily as devastating enhanced **Strikes** (`Strike`). This framework is a starting point; your Champion's power comes from within – define what drives yours.

- **What could your Champion be?**
  - A determined protector whose conviction creates shields of shimmering force.
  - A tribal warrior who commands earth to rise as protective walls through stomps or gestures.
  - A disciplined combatant whose powerful stance establishes zones of defense.
  - A resolute individual whose sheer stubbornness materializes as physical obstacles.
- **How does your strength manifest?** Battle cries? Precise martial technique? Sheer unstoppable will?

#### **3.3.2 Trickster (Dexterity)**

Tricksters excel through speed, precision, and cunning, their enhanced agility allowing them to **Move** (`Move`) with supernatural grace. They might use magically guided attacks (`Strike`/`Bolt`), misdirection (`Illusion`), or sheer nimbleness to confound foes and navigate danger. This is just a template; your Trickster's style is yours to define.

- **What could your Trickster be?**
  - A shadow dancer who blinks short distances between attacks.
  - A seemingly luck-touched gambler whose throws always hit their mark.
  - A battlefield acrobat whose dazzling movements confound opponents.
  - A silent hunter who seems to glide through any environment unseen.
- **How does your dexterity express itself?** Subtle and secretive? Flamboyant and showy? Methodical and precise?

#### **3.3.3 Adapter (Constitution)**

Adapters draw power from their remarkable resilience and life force, their bodies capable of extraordinary transformation (**Adapt Self**). They endure, evolve, and overcome challenges by altering their very form, making their body both weapon (`Strike`/`Bolt`) and shield (`Defend`). But the specifics are yours to create; the Adapter's power is personal.

- **What could your Adapter be?**
  - A shapeshifter whose limbs become claws, wings, or fins as needed.
  - A stoic warrior whose skin temporarily hardens like stone or bark against attacks.
  - A survivor whose wounds close with unnatural speed (`Heal`).
  - A symbiotic host sharing consciousness and physical traits with another entity.
- **How does your body change?** Controlled evolution? Primal response? Ancient magic? Strange experimentation?

#### **3.3.4 Scholar (Intelligence)**

Scholars reshape reality through careful study, pattern recognition, and the precise application of knowledge. Their intellect allows them to affect the world, often from afar, whether through direct force (`Bolt`), intricate control over objects and energy (**Manipulate**), or understanding the underlying principles of magic and nature. This archetype is broad; the Scholar's power comes from understanding – what do *you* seek to comprehend?

- **What could your Scholar be?**
  - A traditional arcanist translating ancient formulae into tangible effects.
  - An inventor whose calculated understanding allows for precise telekinetic control.
  - A battlefield tactician who redirects energy and subtly alters terrain (`Zone`).
  - A researcher who perceives and interacts with the hidden connections between all things.
- **What knowledge drives you?** Forbidden texts? Science? Math? Laws of magic or nature?

#### **3.3.5 Sage (Wisdom)**

Sages perceive what others cannot, drawing on intuition, experience, and a connection to the world around them to see hidden truths (**Arcane Sight**). Their wisdom often allows them to heal (`Heal`), guide (`Communicate`), protect (`Defend`), and understand deeper patterns, sometimes drawing on forces larger than themselves (`Summon`/`Zone`). The Sage's insight is unique – what informs yours?

- **What could your Sage be?**
  - A nature-connected guide who communes with animal spirits or channels natural energies.
  - A temple guardian sensing disturbances in spiritual harmony or reading auras.
  - A battlefield medic whose intuitive understanding of life force saves lives.
  - A keen investigator who notices the smallest details and understands underlying motives.
- **What guides your perception?** A connection to spirits or divinity? Deep practical experience and observation? Strong emotional intuition and empathy?

#### **3.3.6 Orator (Charisma)**

Orators command attention and shape reality through sheer force of personality, their presence allowing them to **Influence** (`Influence`) minds, emotions, and even the flow of magic itself. Their power might erupt as spectacular displays (`Blast`/`Bolt`), subtle manipulations (`Illusion`), compelling commands (`Communicate`), or pact-bound abilities (`Summon`). The Orator's power reflects their unique character – how does yours shine?

- **What could your Orator be?**
  - An innately powerful individual whose strong emotions manifest as magical effects.
  - A pact-bound intermediary channeling otherworldly power through carefully worded agreements.
  - A stirring leader whose inspiring words literally empower allies (`Empower`).
  - A silver-tongued negotiator whose bargains and pronouncements hold magical weight.
- **How does your personality affect the world?** Captivating performance? Resolute command? Subtle manipulation and charm? Unfiltered emotional expression?
