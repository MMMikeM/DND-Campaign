# 3. Classes: The Heart of Your Hero

Classes in this system aren't rigid archetypes—they're flexible frameworks for your character's approach to magic and adventure. Each class is aligned with one of the six core ability scores, giving you a foundation that celebrates your character's natural strengths while leaving plenty of room for your unique interpretation.

> **What Makes Classes Special?**
>
> * Your class isn't just what you do—it's _how_ you do it
> * Each class offers a unique Spell that only they can access
> * Classes determine your hit points, proficiencies, and initial spell selection
> * Your **Spell Points (SP)** and **Maximum SP per Activation** increase automatically with your character level (see **Table 2-1 in Section 6.4**)

## 3.1 Starting Spells

At 1st level, you begin knowing **four spells** that form the foundation of your magical repertoire:

1. **Core Attack Spell:** Your primary magical attack—either `Strike` or `Bolt` (or a choice between them, depending on your class)
2. **Unique Spell:** A distinctive spell that only your class can access, representing its fundamental approach to magic
3. **Choice Spells:** Two additional spells you select from your class's available options, letting you customize your initial capabilities
