## 1. Introduction

### **1.1 Welcome: Doing Cool Shit**

Welcome to a tabletop roleplaying game built from the ground up with one
goal: **Empower you to do cool shit with as little friction as
possible.** Forget dense rulebooks filled with exceptions and edge
cases. This system is designed for dynamic, imaginative play where your
character’s unique abilities and your clever ideas take center stage.

This is a game about heroes wielding incredible power, shaped not just
by rigid rules, but by their personality, history, and the fundamental
magical **Essences** they command. You won’t find sprawling spell lists
here. Instead, you’ll master core **Spells** – versatile templates
representing fundamental magical concepts – and customize them on the
fly with **Essences** and tactical **Enhancements**.

Want your energy blast to be a searing flame that pushes enemies back? A
crackling bolt of lightning that chains between targets? A wave of
chilling frost that slows them to a crawl? You can build that,
expressing *your* character’s specific brand of magic.

> **Magic in Action:** Lyra faces three charging goblins. “I slam my
> staff down and channel earth energy into a Blast!” She spends 2 SP for
> a standard Blast, adds Fire essence, and the Forceful enhancement (+1
> SP). The goblins fail their saves and are pushed back by the wave of
> molten stone erupting from the ground – exactly the breathing room
> Lyra needed.

Get ready to weave compelling stories, face daunting challenges, and
unleash your creativity.

### **1.2 Our Design Philosophy**

These rules are guided by a core set of principles aimed at creating the
best possible play experience:

- **Narrative First:** The story you and your friends create together is
  paramount. Rules serve the story, providing structure for action and
  resolution, but should never stifle a great idea. Player inspiration
  drives the game.
- **Clarity:** Rules are written to be obvious and jargon-light. We aim
  for intuitive mechanics you can understand quickly and use
  confidently. No hidden traps or obscure interactions buried in
  footnotes.
- **Simplicity:** The core mechanics are designed to be lightweight and
  easy to grasp. While your magical effects can become complex and
  layered through Enhancements, the underlying system remains
  streamlined.
- **Versatility:** The magic system (Spells + Essences + Enhancements)
  is modular. Mix and match components to create the precise effects you
  envision, when you need them.
- **Fun:** Every choice should feel meaningful and exciting. Your
  character’s abilities are tools designed to spark clever tactics and
  rewarding moments, not bog down the game.
- **Creativity:** Mechanics should be a launchpad for imagination, not a
  straitjacket. This system encourages you to describe *how* your
  character’s magic looks, feels, and manifests, celebrating unique
  flair over rote recitation.
- **Balance:** We aim for earned power and fair challenges. Choices
  should be meaningful, without obvious “best” options or game-breaking
  combos. Every character path should feel viable and rewarding.
- **Clean Design:** We’ve avoided legacy bloat and unnecessary
  complexity. This is a refined, streamlined system focused on doing its
  job elegantly.

> ✨ **Our Golden Rule:**  
> If a rule ever blocks a great idea or feels too complicated for the
> fun it provides, we tweak the rule—not the idea.  
> **If it isn’t fun, it isn’t right.**

### **1.3 What You Need to Play**

To play, you’ll need a few things:

- **Friends:** Typically one **Game Master (GM)** to guide the story and
  adjudicate rules, and 2-5 **Players** portraying their characters.
- **Dice:** A standard set of polyhedral dice (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12,
  d20) is recommended for each player.
- **Character Sheets:** To record your character’s details (a template
  may be provided separately).
- **Pencils & Paper:** For notes, mapping, and tracking temporary
  effects.
- **Imagination:** The most crucial component!

### **1.4 How to Use These Rules**

This book is structured to get you playing quickly:

1.  **Section 2: Forging Your Character:** This is your starting point.
    It guides you step-by-step through creating your unique hero, from
    initial concept to final details.
2.  **Sections 3-7:** These sections detail the core mechanics
    underpinning your character’s abilities – Classes, Essences, Spells,
    Spell Points, and Enhancements. You’ll reference these during
    character creation and throughout play.

Don’t feel you need to memorize everything upfront. To start, you only
need the following:

- Your character (Section 2)
- The basics of their Class (Section 3)
- Your two selected Essences (Section 4)
- Your four selected Spells (Section 5)

Spell Points (Section 6) and Enhancements (Section 7) will become
relevant as you progress through the game.

Now, gather your dice, spark your imagination, and let’s forge a hero!
Turn to **Section 2: Forging Your Character** to begin.

## 2 Character Creation Guide: Forging Your Hero

Welcome to a world where your magical identity is shaped not by rigid
spell lists, but by your character’s unique story and style. This guide
walks you through creating someone you’re excited to play—focusing on
narrative first, with mechanics that support your vision.

### 2.1 The Spark: Your Character Concept

Before touching dice or numbers, envision who your character is at their
core:

- **What’s their story?** A village healer who whispers to spirits? A
  former soldier with nothing left to lose? A street criminal who
  discovered magic by accident?
- **What’s their approach to problems?** Bold confrontation? Clever
  misdirection? Careful analysis? Inspiring leadership?
- **What sets them apart?** Unusual talents? A distinctive appearance? A
  unique magical style?

> **Example Concept:** Thorne was once a respected temple guardian
> before his reckless pursuit of power led to the shrine’s destruction.
> Now he channels earth essence through disciplined martial forms,
> seeking redemption by protecting others—even as the ghosts of his past
> haunt his dreams.

**Need Inspiration?** Roll a d6 on each table or pick one option from
each to generate a foundation for your character:

| Background (d6) | Motivation (d6) | Temperament (d6) | Approach (d6) |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| 1\. Disgraced noble | 1\. Revenge | 1\. Calculated | 1\. Scholarly analysis |
| 2\. Former cultist | 2\. Redemption | 2\. Impulsive | 2\. Brute force |
| 3\. Wilderness survivor | 3\. Discovery | 3\. Stoic | 3\. Social manipulation |
| 4\. Guild artisan | 4\. Protection | 4\. Curious | 4\. Intuitive instinct |
| 5\. Street criminal | 5\. Ambition | 5\. Passionate | 5\. Adaptive improvisation |
| 6\. Accidental hero | 6\. Legacy | 6\. Cautious | 6\. Meticulous planning |

> **Concept Example:** Rolling 4-2-5-3 gives a guild artisan motivated
> by redemption with a passionate temperament who approaches problems
> through social manipulation; perhaps a silver-tongued former jeweler
> who betrayed their guild and now uses manipulation magic to make
> amends.

### 2.2 Choosing Your Class

Your Class defines *how* your character channels magical power and
approaches challenges. It provides your core archetype and mechanical
framework.

**Classes at a Glance:**

| Class | Key Ability | Unique Spell | Hit Die | Archetype |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Champion | Strength | Barrier | d10 | Protector, mighty warrior |
| Trickster | Dexterity | Move | d8 | Swift, cunning combatant |
| Adapter | Constitution | Adapt Self | d10 | Resilient, shapeshifting survivor |
| Scholar | Intelligence | Manipulate | d6 | Brilliant, calculated caster |
| Sage | Wisdom | Arcane Sight | d8 | Perceptive, intuitive guide |
| Orator | Charisma | Influence | d8 | Compelling, force of personality |

Each class provides:

- A **Key Ability** that powers your magic
- A unique **Spell** only your class can access
- **Hit Die** type determining your health
- **Proficiencies** in armor, weapons, and saving throws

**Class Flavor Examples:**

**Champion:** *Kendra slams her warhammer into the ground, channeling
earth essence. A wall of stone erupts before her, shielding her
companions from the dragon’s breath. “Stand behind me!” she commands,
her magical barriers as unyielding as her resolve.*

**Trickster:** *Vex winks at her pursuer before stepping into a shadow
and seemingly vanishing. A heartbeat later, she materializes behind the
guards, already halfway down the corridor. “Better luck next time,
gentlemen,” she calls back, tossing their stolen keys playfully.*

**Adapter:** *Cornered by the patrol, Kira closes her eyes and takes a
deep breath. When she opens them, her skin has taken on the mottled gray
of stone, her hands have transformed into jagged claws. “You really
don’t want this fight,” she growls.*

**Scholar:** *As the lock mechanism activates, Elara quickly traces
intricate geometric symbols. “The pattern suggests a quaternary
sequence,” she murmurs, as components begin to float apart in midair,
rearranged by her telekinetic precision.*

**Sage:** *As the party debates their next move, Orrin closes his eyes
and extends his awareness beyond physical sight. “Wait,” he says
quietly. “There’s a presence here that doesn’t belong to this time… and
it’s watching us right now.”*

**Orator:** *When negotiations begin to collapse, Lyria steps forward,
her voice resonating with subtle harmonics. “Perhaps we’ve been looking
at this all wrong,” she suggests, her words carrying an almost tangible
weight as the hostile delegates find themselves nodding along.*

> **Selection Tip:** Choose a class that aligns with your character
> concept and whose Key Ability you want to excel in.

### 2.3 Defining Your Abilities

Abilities represent your character’s natural talents. In this system, we
use **ability modifiers** (ranging from -1 to +3) to represent these
talents:

| Ability | Description | What It Represents |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Strength (Str)** | Physical power and athletic capability | Lifting, melee attacks, breaking objects |
| **Dexterity (Dex)** | Agility, reflexes and precision | Balance, stealth, ranged attacks, reaction time |
| **Constitution (Con)** | Endurance, vitality, resilience | Health, stamina, resistance to poison/disease |
| **Intelligence (Int)** | Reasoning, knowledge | Problem-solving, recall, academic knowledge |
| **Wisdom (Wis)** | Perception, intuition, awareness | Noticing details, reading situations, willpower |
| **Charisma (Cha)** | Personal magnetism, force of will | Social influence, leadership, performance |

**Ability Modifier Scale:**

- **+3**: Exceptional talent, among the best in the world
- **+2**: Remarkable aptitude, well above average
- **+1**: Above average capability
- **+0**: Average human capability
- **-1**: Below average, a notable weakness

> **Specialization Creates Depth:** A brilliant scholar might struggle
> to lift heavy objects. A mighty champion might miss social cues. These
> contrasts create interesting narrative opportunities and encourage
> teamwork.

**Assign these modifiers to your abilities:** `+3, +2, +1, +0, +0, -1`

**Recommended Distribution:**

1.  Assign your **+3** to your class’s **Key Ability**
2.  Distribute remaining modifiers to reflect your character’s other
    talents and weaknesses

**Example Distribution:** *Thorne the Champion assigns +3 to Strength
(his Key Ability), +2 to Constitution (for endurance), +1 to Charisma
(natural leadership), +0 to Wisdom and Dexterity, and -1 to Intelligence
(he’s never been one for book learning).*

### 2.4 Core Mechanics

#### Proficiency Bonus

This system uses a fixed **Proficiency Bonus (+3)** regardless of
character level, emphasizing ability selection and specialization over
level scaling.

#### Skill Proficiencies

Choose **two skills** from this list to gain proficiency. When making a
skill check, add your ability modifier (and proficiency bonus if
proficient) to a d20 roll.

| Str       | Dex             | Int           | Wis             | Cha          | Con      |
|:----------|:----------------|:--------------|:----------------|:-------------|:---------|
| Athletics | Acrobatics      | Arcana        | Animal Handling | Deception    | *(None)* |
|           | Sleight of Hand | History       | Insight         | Intimidation |          |
|           | Stealth         | Investigation | Medicine        | Performance  |          |
|           |                 | Nature        | Perception      | Persuasion   |          |
|           |                 | Religion      | Survival        |              |          |

**Skill Check Formula:**
`1d20 + Ability Modifier + Proficiency Bonus (if proficient)`

**Example:** *Thorne the Champion has Athletics proficiency and Strength
+3. When climbing a cliff, he rolls: 1d20 + 3 (Strength) + 3
(Proficiency) = 1d20 + 6*

#### Saving Throws

Your class grants proficiency in two saving throws:

- **Champion:** Strength, Constitution
- **Trickster:** Dexterity, Intelligence
- **Adapter:** Constitution, Wisdom
- **Scholar:** Intelligence, Wisdom
- **Sage:** Wisdom, Charisma
- **Orator:** Charisma, Dexterity

**Saving Throw Formula:**
`1d20 + Ability Modifier + Proficiency Bonus (if proficient)`

**Example:** *Thorne must resist a mind-affecting spell with a Wisdom
save. He rolls: 1d20 + 0 (Wisdom) + 0 (not proficient) = 1d20 + 0*

#### Spellcasting

Your **Spellcasting Ability Modifier** (Spell Mod) is the modifier from
your class’s Key Ability.

- **Spell Attack Bonus = Your Spellcasting Ability Modifier**
- **Spell Save DC = 10 + Your Spellcasting Ability Modifier**

**Example:** *Thorne has Strength +3 as his Key Ability. His Spell
Attack Bonus is +3, and his Spell Save DC is 13.*

### 2.5 Shaping Your Magic

#### Choose Essences

**Essences** define how your magic looks, feels, and what damage type it
deals.

1.  **Choose Two Essence Descriptors** from: Fire, Cold, Life, Necrotic,
    Light, Shadow, Lightning, Earth, Psychic, Force, Sound, Toxic
2.  **Match to Your Concept:** Your essences should reflect your
    character’s story and approach to magic

**Essence Examples in Play:**

- A Champion who served as a lighthouse keeper might choose **Light**
  and **Force**, manifesting shields of blinding energy
- A Trickster raised among thieves might choose **Shadow** and
  **Sound**, creating diversions and illusions
- A Sage who survived in the wilderness might choose **Life** and
  **Earth**, channeling primal nature forces

Each time you cast a spell, you choose which of your two essences to
apply, determining both its damage type and how it manifests in the
world.

#### Select Spells

Your Class grants you four **Base Spells**:

1.  **Core Attack Spell:** Your primary offensive option (`Strike`,
    `Bolt`, or a choice between them)
2.  **Unique Spell:** A distinctive spell that only your class can
    access
3.  **Choice Spells:** Select **two** additional spells from your
    class’s available options

Record your spells and their **Basic Effects** (0 SP cost)—these 0 SP
effects are always available to you.

**Spell Examples:**

- **Strike (Basic, 0 SP):** *Making a weapon attack that deals extra
  essence damage equal to your Spell Mod. “My axe glows with earth
  energy as I swing it at the orc!”*

- **Bolt (Basic, 0 SP):** *Firing a ranged magical attack that deals
  1d10 essence damage. “I launch a streak of shadow energy at the
  distant archer!”*

- **Barrier (Basic, 0 SP):** *Creating a 5x5 ft plane of energy that
  provides half cover. “I quickly raise a small wall of stone to shield
  myself from the arrows!”*

- **Heal (Basic, 0 SP):** *Restoring 1d4 + Spell Mod hit points to a
  touched creature. “I place my hands on your wound, channeling life
  essence to knit the flesh.”*

### 2.6 Adding Character Depth

#### Your Hindrance

Every hero has a weakness or complication that adds depth and creates
dramatic opportunities. This is your **Hindrance**.

Your Hindrance occasionally creates trouble for your character. When it
causes a **Meaningful Complication** during play, the GM may award you a
**Fate Undo Token**.

##### Meaningful Complication

A **Meaningful Complication** is an instance where your Hindrance
directly creates a significant obstacle or difficulty that impacts the
unfolding scene or challenges your character’s immediate goals.

It should:

- Create a genuine obstacle or limitation
- Force difficult choices
- Change the course of action your character would have taken otherwise
- Have consequences beyond a single failed roll

While your hindrance can enrich the description of your character’s
struggle without concrete impact on the situation is generally *not* a
Meaningful Complication.

##### Fate Undo Token

When awarded a Fate Undo Token, you can spend it at any point of your
choosing to trigger one of the following effects:

- **Undo your last action:** Reroll your last d20 roll and choose which
  result to use.
- **Undo target’s action:** Reroll a hostile creature’s last d20 roll
  against you and choose which result to use.
- **Rewrite a moment:** Revise your last narrative action (GM
  discretion).

##### Examples of Meaningful Complications

Here are examples of how different Hindrances could create a Meaningful
Complication that earns a Fate Undo Token:

- **Code-Bound**: You refuse to take the most efficient or safe path
  because it violates your code (e.g., refusing to steal a necessary
  item, choosing not to attack a defenseless enemy even when tactically
  vital).
- **Old Injury**: Your injury causes you to fail a crucial physical task
  you would normally succeed at, directly hindering an important action
  (e.g., failing a jump necessary to escape, dropping a heavy but
  essential item mid-climb).
- **Notorious Reputation**: Being recognized by someone in power or a
  hostile faction directly prevents access, initiates unwanted conflict,
  or causes a crucial NPC to refuse aid.
- **Magical Resonance**: Your uncontrolled magical side effect directly
  disrupts a key action, reveals the party’s presence when stealth was
  critical, or causes unintended harm/difficulty.

##### Hindrance Categories

**Personality Hindrances:**

- **Code-Bound**: You follow principles that sometimes limit your
  options
- **Impulsive**: You act before thinking when emotions run high
- **Stubbornly Independent**: You refuse help even when you need it

**Physical Hindrances:**

- **Old Injury**: A permanent wound sometimes flares up at the worst
  moments
- **Recognizable Mark**: A distinctive appearance makes you easy to
  identify and remember
- **Chronic Condition**: An illness or condition that requires
  management and occasionally worsens

**Social Hindrances:**

- **Notorious Reputation**: Your name or face is associated with events
  you may or may not be responsible for
- **Outsider**: Your origins or appearance mark you as different in most
  communities
- **Nemesis**: Someone powerful holds a grudge against you and actively
  works against you

**Supernatural Hindrances:**

- **Haunted**: Spirits, memories, or actual ghosts follow you
- **Marked by Power**: Your connection to magic is visible and
  potentially alarming to others
- **Cosmic Attention**: Something beyond mortal understanding has
  noticed you

##### Paying Hindrances Effectively

The best hindrances:

- **Connect to your character’s backstory:** “My fear of fire stems from
  watching my village burn.”
- **Create dramatic moments:** “I insist we help these refugees, even
  though it will delay our critical mission.”
- **Evolve over time:** “I’m learning to control my anger, but certain
  triggers still send me over the edge.”
- **Balance limitation with agency:** “I cannot lie due to my oath, but
  I can find creative ways to misdirect.”

> **Player Tip:** Don’t wait for the GM to invoke your hindrance!
> Proactively look for opportunities to demonstrate how it affects your
> character. Say “This is where my hindrance would come into play” if
> you think a situation warrants it.

##### Hindrance in Action

**GM:** “The noble offers you gold to retrieve an item from the haunted
ruins. He seems nervous, not telling you everything.”

**Player (with ‘Code-Bound’ hindrance):** “My character has a code that
demands full honesty in agreements. I press him for the complete truth,
even though it might cost us the job.”

**GM:** “The noble hesitates, then admits the item belongs to a rival
and this is essentially a theft. He offers more gold for your
discretion.”

**Player:** “I refuse the job outright and suggest we leave. This goes
against my code of honor.”

**GM:** “That’s a meaningful complication from your hindrance—you’re
giving up a lucrative opportunity that would have advanced the plot.
Here’s a Fate Undo Token.”

#### The Final Flourishes

Complete your character with these important finishing touches:

##### Name

What are you called? Does your name have meaning or history?

> Examples: Thorne, named for the thornbushes where he was found as an
> infant

##### Apearance

What immediately stands out about you? Any distinctive features?

> Examples: Runes tattooed on the back of his hands that glow when he
> uses his magic

##### Prsonality

Note key traits, ideals, and bonds.

> **Examples:** Quiet but observant, with occasional bursts of dry
> humor. Believes knowledge should be free to all

##### Anchor

What keeps you grounded when everything else fails?

> **Examples:**
>
> - **A memento:** “My father’s broken sword reminds me why I fight.”
> - **A promise:** “I swore to return to my village with the cure.”
> - **A principle:** “Justice must prevail, even when mercy cannot.”

##### Question

What unresolved mystery drives you forward?

> **Examples:**
>
> - **Personal:** “Who killed my mentor, and why?”
> - **Identity:** “Am I truly the last of my kind?”
> - **Purpose:** “What is my magic truly capable of?”

### 2.7 Game Mechanics

#### Hit Points (HP)

Starting HP = Maximum value of your Class Hit Die + your Constitution
modifier

> **Examples:**
>
> - A Champion (d10) with +1 Constitution starts with 11 HP
> - A Scholar (d6) with +0 Constitution starts with 6 HP
> - An Adapter (d10) with +2 Constitution starts with 12 HP

#### Spell Points (SP)

At 1st level, you have **10 SP**. You can spend a maximum of **3 SP** on
a single spell activation. You regain all SP after a Long Rest.

> **SP in Action:** *Thorne knows the Bolt spell. At 1st level, he can
> only use its Basic Effect (0 SP). At 2nd level, he might learn the
> Standard Bolt Mode (2 SP), allowing him to cast a bolt that deals 3d8
> damage.*

#### Looking Ahead

As you gain levels, you’ll learn **Enhancements** (2 per level from
level 2 onwards) that let you spend SP to customize your spells in
creative ways.

> **Example:** *At 3rd level, Thorne could enhance his Bolt spell with
> both the “Chain Bolt” (+2 SP) to create a powerful fire bolt that
> jumps from one enemy to another.* **Remember:** Characters evolve
> through play. You don’t need perfect details to start having fun—the
> most memorable development often emerges organically from shared
> adventures!

## 3. Classes: The Heart of Your Hero

Your class represents not merely what your character does, but *how*
they channel magical power and approach challenges. Each class is a
flexible framework aligned with one of the six core ability scores,
celebrating your natural strengths while leaving ample room for your
unique interpretive flair.

### **3.1 Starting Spells**

At 1st level, you begin with **four foundational spells** that form the
bedrock of your magical repertoire:

1.  **Core Attack Spell:** Your primary magical offensive option—either
    `Strike` (melee), `Bolt` (ranged), or a choice between them,
    depending on your class
2.  **Unique Spell:** A distinctive magical ability that only your class
    can access, representing its fundamental approach to magic
3.  **Choice Spells:** Two additional spells you select from your
    class’s available options, allowing you to customize your initial
    capabilities

> **Magical Foundation Tip:** When selecting your choice spells,
> consider balancing offense, defense, and utility. Even combat-focused
> characters benefit from having at least one non-combat option in their
> initial spell selection.

### **3.2 The Six Classes**

#### **3.2.1 Champion**

> *Force of will made manifest*

Key Ability: **Strength**

Champions transform raw physical power into tangible magical effects.
Their might isn’t just muscle—it’s an extension of an unbreakable will
that both protects allies and devastates enemies. Whether manifesting as
shimmering barriers, earthen walls that rise at a stomp, or strikes that
channel supernatural force, a Champion’s magic is physical prowess
incarnate.

**The Champion’s Power:** Their unique spell, `Barrier`, creates
physical manifestations of their protective instinct. Combined with
their enhanced `Strike`, Champions excel at controlling the battlefield
while dealing significant damage.

> **Champion in Action:** Thorne slams his greataxe into the ground,
> channeling earth essence through his weapon. “Stand behind me!” he
> commands as a wall of jagged stone erupts in a protective semicircle,
> buying his companions precious moments to regroup as the goblin horde
> crashes against his newly-formed bulwark.

| Aspect | Details |
|:---|:---|
| **Core Ability** | Strength |
| **Hit Dice** | d10 |
| **Armor** | All armor types and shields |
| **Weapons** | Simple and martial weapons |
| **Core Attack** | `Strike` |
| **Unique Spell** | `Barrier` |
| **Spell Options** | `Blast`, `Debilitate`, `Defend`, `Empower/Enfeeble`, `Heal`, `Zone` |

**What Might Drive Your Champion?**

- Righteous determination to stand between innocents and harm
- Ancestral traditions channeling earth or stone through powerful
  stances
- Unbending will that refuses to yield, creating obstacles through sheer
  stubbornness
- Disciplined martial techniques that harness inner force to establish
  zones of control

**Finding Your Champion’s Voice:** How does your strength manifest
magically? Through thunderous battle cries? Precise martial forms? The
weight of your convictions? The earth responding to your footfalls? Your
Champion’s power source is yours to define.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **3.2.2 Trickster**

> *Swift, cunning, and always one step ahead*

Key Ability: **Dexterity**

Tricksters embody the magic of motion, precision, and cunning. Their
supernatural agility allows them to be where they shouldn’t, strike with
uncanny accuracy, and slip away before consequences catch up. Whether
dancing through shadows, performing impossible acrobatics, or throwing
weapons with preternatural precision, the Trickster makes the
extraordinary look effortless.

**The Trickster’s Edge:** Their unique spell, `Move`, represents their
unmatched mobility. Combined with their choice of attack spell (`Strike`
or `Bolt`), Tricksters excel at positioning, hit-and-run tactics, and
confounding foes with misdirection.

> **Trickster in Action:** With three guards closing in, Vex winks at
> her pursuer before stepping into a shadow and seemingly vanishing. A
> heartbeat later, she materializes behind them all, already halfway
> down the hall. “Better luck next time, gentlemen,” she calls back with
> a laugh, tossing a stolen medallion playfully as she disappears around
> the corner.

| Aspect | Details |
|:---|:---|
| **Core Ability** | Dexterity |
| **Hit Dice** | d8 |
| **Armor** | Light armor |
| **Weapons** | Simple weapons, hand crossbows, longswords, rapiers, shortswords, shortbows |
| **Core Attack** | Choose `Strike` OR `Bolt` |
| **Unique Spell** | `Move` |
| **Spell Options** | `Blast`, `Communicate`, `Conduit`, `Debilitate`, `Defend`, `Illusion` |

**What Might Shape Your Trickster?**

- A shadow dancer who briefly steps between realities to reappear
  elsewhere
- A “lucky” gambler whose throws and shots always find their mark
- A battlefield acrobat who leaves opponents dizzy and disoriented
- A hunter whose movements are so fluid and silent they seem
  supernatural

**Finding Your Trickster’s Style:** How does your dexterity express
itself? Through subtle, nearly invisible movements? Flashy, impossible
acrobatics? Methodical precision that never wastes motion? Your
Trickster’s signature style is yours to create.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **3.2.3 Adapter**

> *Evolution incarnate*

Key Ability: **Constitution**

Adapters draw power from their remarkable resilience, channeling their
life force into extraordinary transformations. Their bodies become both
weapon and shield, changing to meet any challenge. Whether growing
natural weapons, hardening their skin to deflect blows, or healing with
unnatural speed, the Adapter’s body is their greatest tool—constantly
evolving, always surviving.

**The Adapter’s Transformation:** Their unique spell, `Adapt Self`,
represents their physical mutability. Combined with their choice of
attack spell and defensive capabilities, Adapters excel at survival,
adaptation, and overcoming seemingly impossible obstacles.

> **Adapter in Action:** Cornered by the patrol, Kira closes her eyes
> and takes a deep breath. When she opens them again, her skin has taken
> on the mottled gray of stone, her hands have transformed into jagged
> claws, and her senses have sharpened to predatory acuity. “You really
> don’t want this fight,” she growls, her voice now carrying a primal
> edge that makes even the veteran guards hesitate.

| Aspect | Details |
|:---|:---|
| **Core Ability** | Constitution |
| **Hit Dice** | d10 |
| **Armor** | Light armor, medium armor, shields |
| **Weapons** | Simple weapons |
| **Core Attack** | Choose `Strike` OR `Bolt` |
| **Unique Spell** | `Adapt Self` |
| **Spell Options** | `Blast`, `Debilitate`, `Defend`, `Heal`, `Summon`, `Zone` |

**What Might Form Your Adapter?**

- A shapeshifter whose limbs become claws, wings, or fins as needed
- A stoic warrior whose skin temporarily hardens like stone or bark
- A survivor whose wounds close with unnatural rapidity
- A symbiotic host sharing consciousness with another entity that grants
  gifts

**Finding Your Adapter’s Catalyst:** What triggers your transformations?
Primal instinct? Careful concentration? Ancient bloodline magic? The
remnants of strange experiments? Your Adapter’s source of change is
yours to determine.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **3.2.4 Scholar**

> *Knowledge that reshapes reality*

Key Ability: **Intelligence**

Scholars bend reality through careful study, pattern recognition, and
the precise application of knowledge. Their intellect gives them power
over forces that others barely comprehend, allowing them to affect the
world through understanding rather than brute force. Whether translating
ancient formulae into tangible effects, leveraging mathematical
precision for telekinesis, or analyzing the weaknesses in reality’s
fabric, the Scholar’s mind is their greatest weapon.

**The Scholar’s Mastery:** Their unique spell, `Manipulate`, represents
their fine control over objects and energy. Combined with their ranged
attacks (`Bolt`), Scholars excel at precision, problem-solving, and
controlling the battlefield from a distance.

> **Scholar in Action:** As the lock mechanism activates, Elara quickly
> traces the intricate geometric symbols she had memorized earlier and
> extends her hand toward the mechanism. “The pattern suggests a
> quaternary sequence,” she murmurs, as components begin to float apart
> in midair. With careful gestures, she rearranges the tumblers
> telekinetically, bypassing the trap that would have triggered had
> anyone touched it physically.

| Aspect | Details |
|:---|:---|
| **Core Ability** | Intelligence |
| **Hit Dice** | d6 |
| **Armor** | None |
| **Weapons** | Daggers, darts, slings, quarterstaffs, light crossbows |
| **Core Attack** | `Bolt` |
| **Unique Spell** | `Manipulate` |
| **Spell Options** | `Blast`, `Communicate`, `Debilitate`, `Defend`, `Illusion`, `Zone` |

**What Might Define Your Scholar?**

- A traditional arcanist translating complex formulae into magical
  effects
- An inventor whose scientific mind allows for precise telekinetic
  control
- A battlefield tactician who redirects energy and subtly alters terrain
- A researcher who perceives and manipulates the hidden connections
  between all things

**Finding Your Scholar’s Source:** What knowledge empowers you?
Forbidden magical texts? Scientific principles? Mathematical formulas?
Laws of metaphysics? Your Scholar’s intellectual focus is yours to
develop.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **3.2.5 Sage**

> *Perceiving what others cannot*

Key Ability: **Wisdom**

Sages draw power from perception, intuition, and a deep connection to
the world around them. They see truths hidden from others, whether
through communion with spirits, reading auras, or an uncanny
understanding of patterns and motivations. Whether healing wounds
through insight into life’s flow, communing with entities beyond mortal
ken, or anticipating an opponent’s next move before they make it, the
Sage’s awareness transcends ordinary limitations.

**The Sage’s Insight:** Their unique spell, `Arcane Sight`, represents
their extraordinary perception. Combined with their flexible choice of
attack spell and supportive abilities, Sages excel at guidance, healing,
protection, and understanding deeper patterns in the world.

> **Sage in Action:** As the party debates their next move, Orrin closes
> his eyes and extends his awareness beyond physical sight. The ruins
> suddenly appear differently to him—spectral imprints of past events
> shimmer in the air, while threads of magical energy pulse beneath the
> stone. “Wait,” he says quietly, eyes still closed. “There’s a presence
> here that doesn’t belong to this time… and it’s watching us right
> now.”

| Aspect | Details |
|:---|:---|
| **Core Ability** | Wisdom |
| **Hit Dice** | d8 |
| **Armor** | Light armor, medium armor, shields |
| **Weapons** | Simple weapons |
| **Core Attack** | Choose `Strike` OR `Bolt` |
| **Unique Spell** | `Arcane Sight` |
| **Spell Options** | `Communicate`, `Conduit`, `Defend`, `Heal`, `Summon`, `Zone` |

**What Might Guide Your Sage?**

- A nature-connected guide who communes with animal spirits or natural
  energies
- A temple guardian sensing disturbances in spiritual harmony
- A battlefield medic whose intuitive understanding of life force saves
  lives
- An investigator who notices the smallest details and understands
  underlying motives

**Finding Your Sage’s Vision:** What informs your perception? Connection
to spirits or divinity? Decades of practical experience? Emotional
intuition and empathy? Meditation and self-reflection? Your Sage’s
perceptive abilities are yours to envision.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **3.2.6 Orator**

**Orator** \[**OR**-uh-ter\]: A powerful, persuasive speaker whose words
and presence can move hearts, change minds, and in this world—shape
reality itself.

> *Reality shaped through force of personality*

Key Ability: **Charisma**

Orators command attention and shape reality through sheer force of
personality. Their presence allows them to influence minds, emotions,
and even the flow of magic itself. Whether through spectacular displays
of power, subtle manipulations, compelling commands, or pact-bound
abilities, the Orator’s words and presence carry weight that extends
beyond the merely social—they have the power to reshape the world
itself.

**The Orator’s Authority:** Their unique spell, `Influence`, represents
their ability to affect others’ thoughts and actions. Combined with
their offensive capabilities (`Bolt`) and social prowess, Orators excel
at control, leadership, and turning situations to their advantage.

> **Orator in Action:** When negotiations begin to collapse, Lyria steps
> forward, her voice resonating with subtle harmonics as she channels
> sound essence. “Perhaps we’ve been looking at this all wrong,” she
> suggests, her words carrying an almost tangible weight. The hostile
> delegates find themselves nodding along despite their earlier
> positions, momentarily seeing the world through her carefully crafted
> perspective.

| Aspect | Details |
|:---|:---|
| **Core Ability** | Charisma |
| **Hit Dice** | d8 |
| **Armor** | Light armor |
| **Weapons** | Simple weapons, hand crossbows, rapiers, shortswords |
| **Core Attack** | `Bolt` |
| **Unique Spell** | `Influence` |
| **Spell Options** | `Blast`, `Communicate`, `Debilitate`, `Empower/Enfeeble`, `Illusion`, `Summon` |

**What Might Empower Your Orator?**

- An innately magical individual whose emotions manifest as tangible
  effects
- A pact-bound intermediary channeling otherworldly power through
  bargains
- An inspiring leader whose words literally empower allies and
  demoralize foes
- A silver-tongued negotiator whose pronouncements hold magical weight

**Finding Your Orator’s Voice:** How does your personality affect the
world? Through captivating performances? Resolute commands? Subtle
manipulation? Pure emotional expression? Your Orator’s presence is yours
to articulate.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **3.3 Class Selection Strategy**

When choosing your class, consider both mechanical fit and narrative
satisfaction:

**Mechanical Considerations:**

- Does the class’s Key Ability align with where you placed your highest
  modifier?
- Does the play style (front-line fighter, mobile striker, support
  caster) match your preferences?
- Are you drawn to the unique spell and available spell options?

**Narrative Considerations:**

- Does the class’s thematic approach to magic resonate with your
  character concept?
- Can you envision exciting stories emerging from your class’s approach
  to challenges?
- Does the class provide a framework that feels both inspiring and
  flexible?

Remember that your class is a starting point, not a rigid limitation. As
you gain Enhancements and develop your character, you’ll customize your
abilities far beyond the baseline class framework. The most compelling
heroes often develop in surprising ways that transcend simple class
definitions.

## 4. Essences: The Flavors of Magic

> *A frostbite-inducing cold that creaks with each movement, a
> wildfire’s devastating hunger, the silent embrace of shadow, the raw
> kinetic force of a thunderclap—Essences are the fundamental energies
> that give your magic its distinctive character.*

### 4.1 What Are Essences?

**Essences** are the primal magical energies that transform abstract
spells into vivid, sensory experiences. When you cast a generic `Bolt`
spell, it’s the **Fire Essence** that turns it into a searing flame, the
**Lightning Essence** that makes it crackle with electricity, or the
**Shadow Essence** that shapes it into a streak of devouring darkness.

Essences are the bridge between mechanical framework and evocative
storytelling, providing:

- **Sensory Identity** — How your magic looks, sounds, smells, and feels
- **Thematic Connection** — Links your spells to your character’s style
  and story
- **Mechanical Function** — Determines damage type and potential status
  effects

Every spell you cast is shaped by the Essence you apply to it, making
your magic uniquely *yours*.

> **Your Magical Signature**
>
> More than just damage types, Essences are how your character expresses
> their magical identity. A scholarly wizard’s fire might manifest as
> precise, geometric patterns of flame. A primal druid’s lightning could
> appear as crackling vines of electric energy. A brooding warlock’s
> cold essence might manifest as crystalline shards of midnight frost.
> How your Essences look and feel is entirely up to you!

### 4.2 Learning Essences

When you first gain access to Spells (typically at 1st level), you
choose **two Essence Descriptors** from the list in section 4.5 that
reflect your character’s magical identity.

Your chosen Essences might be influenced by:

- Your character’s background or training
- Their personality or emotional tendencies
- Cultural or ancestral traditions
- Personal affinity or magical research

Additional Essences might be learned through special feats or specific
GM-granted opportunities as your adventure progresses.

### 4.3 Using Essences

When you cast a Spell, you choose **one** of your known Essence
Descriptors to apply. This choice shapes how your magic manifests and
determines its damage type (if applicable).

- **Flavor First** — An Essence primarily determines *how* your spell
  manifests. When applying your Fire Essence to a `Heal` spell, you’re
  not burning the target—you might manifest soothing embers that knit
  wounds closed or a phoenix-like warmth that revitalizes.

- **Narrative Freedom** — While your character knows only certain
  Essences, you have freedom in describing the specific way they
  manifest. Your Fire might be roaring flames, concentrated heat, or
  dancing embers—the choice is yours!

- **Sensible Applications** — An Essence should generally align with the
  spell’s function. While creative descriptions are encouraged, applying
  Necrotic Essence to heal a living creature would likely be incongruous
  without special circumstances.

- **No Additional Cost** — Applying a basic Essence doesn’t increase the
  SP cost of your spell.

> **Example: Personalizing Your Magic**
>
> *Aria the Sage casts `Bolt` with **Light Essence**, describing it as
> “a concentrated beam of golden sunlight that leaves sparkling motes in
> its wake.”*
>
> *Thorne the Champion applies **Earth Essence** to their `Barrier`
> spell: “I stomp my foot and a jagged wall of stone erupts from the
> ground, blocking the corridor.”*
>
> *Vex the Trickster uses **Shadow Essence** with their `Move` spell: “I
> dissolve into wisps of darkness, flowing between the guards before
> reforming behind them.”*
>
> *Orrin the Adapter channels **Life Essence** into his `Adapt Self`
> spell: “Bark-like patterns emerge across my skin as leafy vines coil
> around my arms, hardening into natural armor.”*

### 4.4 Mechanical Effects of Essences

While primarily descriptive, Essences have several important mechanical
implications:

#### Damage Type

For damaging spells, the chosen Essence determines the damage type—Fire
damage, Cold damage, Lightning damage, etc. This interacts with creature
resistances and vulnerabilities.

#### Status Effect Associations

Each Essence is linked to a specific **status effect** (see table in
4.5). These effects don’t automatically apply with basic spells, but
certain Enhancements (typically costing +2 SP) can allow you to apply
these status effects.

#### Minor Inherent Effects

Essences provide small, flavorful effects outside of combat—Fire might
ignite torches, Cold might chill drinks, Light might illuminate dark
corners. These are primarily for narrative color rather than mechanical
advantage.

#### Occasional Skill Interactions

The nature of an Essence might occasionally grant circumstantial
benefits relevant to skills—a convincing Shadow illusion might aid
Stealth, for instance. These situational benefits are adjudicated by the
GM based on creative application.

### 4.5 Essence Descriptors

Each Essence represents a fundamental magical energy with unique
properties. Choose one known Essence whenever you cast a spell to
determine its damage type and potentially apply status effects with the
right Enhancements.

| Essence | Status Name | Primary Effect | Secondary Effect | Minor Effect | Feel |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Fire** | **Ignited** | Attack rolls at disadvantage | Vulnerable to Cold damage | Sheds dim light | Burning, searing heat that consumes |
| **Cold** | **Frozen** | Speed becomes 5 ft | Vulnerable to Fire damage | Disadvantage on Athletics checks | Numbing, paralyzing chill |
| **Life** | **Overgrown** | Speed becomes 5 ft | Attacks gain advantage vs target | Disadvantage on grapple/disarm checks | Entangling vines and natural growth |
| **Necrotic** | **Withered** | Attack rolls at disadvantage | Constitution saves at disadvantage | Disadvantage on Strength checks | Decay that saps vitality and strength |
| **Light** | **Dazzled** | Attack rolls at disadvantage | Wisdom saves at disadvantage | Target gains no cover bonus vs caster | Blinding brilliance that disorients |
| **Shadow** | **Shrouded** | -2 AC penalty | Takes Spell Mod extra damage first time hit each turn | Disadvantage on sight-based Perception checks | Cloaking gloom that obscures and weakens |
| **Lightning** | **Conductive** | Attack rolls at disadvantage | Takes Spell Mod extra damage first time hit each turn | Disadvantage on Dexterity checks | Jolting energy that causes muscle spasms |
| **Earth** | **Weighted** | -2 AC penalty | Takes Spell Mod extra damage first time hit each turn | Disadvantage on grapple/disarm checks | Crushing heaviness that limits movement |
| **Psychic** | **Scrambled** | All saves at disadvantage | Hindered Movement (-10 ft & prone/move disadvantage) | Disadvantage on Insight checks | Mind fog that disrupts thought and coordination |
| **Force** | **Unstable** | -2 AC penalty | Attacks gain advantage vs target | Moved +5 ft when pushed/pulled | Kinetic energy that creates off-balance states |
| **Sound** | **Deafened** | All saves at disadvantage | Attacks gain advantage vs target | Casting Interference: DC 10 Con check for V spells | Ear-ringing disorientation that breaks concentration |
| **Toxic** | **Enfeebled** | Attack rolls at disadvantage | Constitution saves at disadvantage | Disadvantage on Constitution checks | Sickening poison that weakens resistance |

#### Using Status Effects

The “Primary Effect,” “Secondary Effect,” and “Minor Effect” listed for
each Essence describe the mechanical and sensory effects a creature
suffers while it is under the influence of the named status (e.g.,
Ignited, Frozen, Dazzled, etc.).

- The Essence’s *damage type* applies automatically to damaging spells
- To **inflict the associated status effect**, you typically spend **+2
  SP** when casting a spell (using an Enhancement that allows this) OR
  use a class feature that applies the status
- Unless specified otherwise, status effects applied this way last until
  the **start of your next turn**

> **Example: Essence in Combat**
>
> *GM: “The ogre towers ahead, its tough skin giving it an AC of 16.”*
>
> *Kira’s storm mage channels crackling energy between her fingertips.
> “You’ll regret that!” I cast **Lightning Bolt** with the Debilitating
> enhancement for 4 SP total.*
>
> *\[Rolls attack dice\] “That’s a 17!”*
>
> *“The bolt strikes true, arcing across the battlefield with a
> thunderous crack! The ogre takes 3d8 lightning damage \[rolls\] for 13
> damage. As electricity courses through its body, it becomes
> **Conductive** - its muscles spasm, making attacks difficult, and its
> skin crackles with residual energy that will amplify the next hit it
> takes.”*
>
> *GM: “The ogre roars in pain as lightning dances across its body. It’s
> now Conductive until the start of your next turn.”*

### 4.6 Evolving Your Essence Expressions

As you advance in experience, consider how your relationship with your
Essences might develop:

- **Growing Mastery**: Your Fire might evolve from wild, untamed flames
  to precisely controlled geometric patterns
- **Personalized Aesthetics**: Your Lightning could develop a signature
  color or distinctive sound that marks it as uniquely yours
- **Deepening Understanding**: Your application of Shadow might progress
  from simple darkness to intricate manipulations of light and
  perception

While the mechanical effects remain consistent, your descriptions can
evolve to reflect your character’s growing mastery and changing
relationship with their magical energies.

> **Advanced Techniques**: Through special feats like “Dual Essence
> Wielder” or “Essence Explorer,” experienced mages might learn to blend
> multiple Essences together or add entirely new Essences to their
> repertoire. Such advanced applications of Essence magic represent
> significant developments in a character’s magical journey.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Remember**: Your Essences represent your magical signature—how you
leave your personal mark on the world through your spellcasting. Embrace
creative descriptions, lean into your character’s personality, and make
your magic come alive at the table!

## 5. Spells: The Frameworks of Magic

> *“A mage who knows a hundred specific spells is limited. A mage who
> masters a dozen fundamental magical concepts and can adapt them
> endlessly? They are truly powerful.”*

### 5.1 The Nature of Spells

In this system, **Spells** are foundational magical concepts—versatile
templates that represent core magical effects like projecting energy,
healing wounds, or creating barriers. Unlike traditional systems with
sprawling spell lists, we focus on a curated set of core spells that
you’ll personalize through **Essences** and **Enhancements**.

Think of Spells as the underlying structure of your magic:

- **Spells** define *what* your magic does (damage, healing, movement)
- **Essences** determine *how* your magic manifests (fire, lightning,
  shadow)
- **Enhancements** control *how powerful* your effects become

This modular approach shifts the focus from memorizing numerous specific
rules to mastering a core framework that you can creatively adapt to any
situation. Your character isn’t limited by a static list of
predetermined effects—they’re empowered to shape their magic according
to their needs and style.

> **Magic in Action: Narrative Drives Mechanics**
>
> *Standing at the edge of a chasm, Lyra plants her feet firmly and
> extends her hands.*
>
> *“I focus my power, drawing stone from the surrounding earth to form a
> solid bridge across the gap,” she declares.*
>
> *The ground trembles as rock and earth rise up, twisting and
> compacting into a sturdy stone bridge that spans the fifteen-foot
> gap.*
>
> **Behind the Magic:** Lyra used her `Barrier` spell with **Earth
> Essence**, choosing the “Shaped Barrier” mode (4 SP) and adding the
> “Expand Barrier” enhancement (+1 SP) to create a structure large
> enough to cross safely.
>
> *Later, in combat, Lyra reacts differently to danger:*
>
> *“I slam my staff down!” Lyra shouts as enemy archers take aim. “A
> wall of shimmering golden light springs up between us and the
> archers!”*
>
> *A translucent barrier of radiant energy materializes, arrows thudding
> harmlessly against its surface.*
>
> **Behind the Magic:** Same spell (`Barrier`), different execution—this
> time with **Light Essence** and the simpler “Standard Barrier” mode (2
> SP) for a quick defensive reaction.

### 5.2 Learning Spells

Characters **know** a set number of Spells, representing the magical
effects they have mastered. Unlike some systems, you don’t prepare
spells daily—your known spells are always available to you.

Your four starting spells form the core of your magical repertoire,
representing the foundational concepts your character has mastered.
Character progression primarily focuses on enhancing these core spells
through Spell Points and Enhancements (see Section 7). While your
character may rarely learn entirely new spells through specific feats or
unique narrative opportunities, the emphasis of this system is on
deepening mastery over breadth of effects.

#### Starting Spells

At 1st level, you know **four Spells** determined as follows:

- Your class grants you a **Core Attack Spell** (`Strike` or `Bolt`, or
  sometimes a choice between them)
- Your class grants you a **Unique Thematic Spell** that only your class
  can access
- You **choose two** additional spells from your class’s specific list
  of **Available Spells**

> **✨ Tip: Complementary Choices**
>
> When choosing your two additional spells, consider how they’ll
> complement your core and unique spells. Look for options that cover
> different situations (combat, exploration, social) or fill different
> roles (offense, defense, utility).

#### Changing Known Spells

Every 4th level (4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, 20th), when you would normally
gain a Feat, you can replace one spell you know with a different spell
from your class spell list, representing your character’s evolving
magical approach.

### 5.3 Spell Descriptions

Each spell follows a standard format detailing its core function before
any Enhancements are applied:

| Element | Description |
|:---|:---|
| **Name** | The generic name representing the spell’s core concept |
| **Casting Time** | Action required (1 Action, Reaction, Special) |
| **Range** | Maximum distance (Self, Touch, 30 feet, etc.) |
| **Components** | By default, all spells require **V** (Verbal) and **M** (Focus) components. **S** (Somatic) is listed only if additional intricate gestures are required beyond handling the focus |
| **Duration** | How long the effect lasts (Instantaneous, 1 round, Concentration up to X) |
| **Core Effect** | Description of what happens when activating the spell at its Base SP Cost |
| **Tags** | Optional keywords like **Concentration** or **Ritual** |

#### Component Notes

- **Verbal (V)** - Spoken words, incantations, or sounds. You must be
  able to speak to fulfill a Verbal component.
- **Material (M)** - A focus that channels your magic (wand, staff,
  crystal, etc.). You must be holding the focus to fulfill a Material
  component. The hand holding the focus is typically sufficient for any
  gestures required by the spell.
- **Somatic (S)** - Complex hand gestures beyond simply pointing your
  focus

#### Common Tags

- **Concentration** - Requires maintaining focus; you can only
  concentrate on one spell at a time
- **Ritual** - Can be cast taking 10 minutes longer without spending SP
  (only for spells with this tag)

### 5.4 Understanding Spell Effects

Each spell has a **Basic Effect** (0 SP) that you can use at will,
similar to a cantrip. This represents the most fundamental application
of the magical concept.

By spending **Spell Points (SP)**, you can activate more powerful
**Modes** of the spell or add **Enhancements** (see Section 7) that
modify its effects. **Modes** are specific predefined ways to use a
spell, while **Enhancements** are customized modifications.

> **Example: Building on Basics**
>
> *“I point my finger at the cultist, and a thin streak of flame darts
> from my fingertip!”*
>
> *This is the `Bolt` spell’s **Basic Effect** (0 SP) with Fire Essence,
> a simple but effective attack.*
>
> *“I channel my power and unleash a blazing fireball that streaks
> toward the cultist leader!”*
>
> *By spending 2 SP for the “Standard Bolt” **Mode**, the mage creates a
> more powerful attack (3d8 damage).*
>
> *“I focus intently, launching a bolt of lightning that arcs from the
> troll to its nearby ally!”*
>
> *Adding the “Chain Bolt” **Enhancement** (+2 SP, total 4 SP) creates a
> bolt that jumps to a second target after hitting the first.*

### 5.5 Core Spells - Basic Effects

The following section details the baseline **Basic Effect** for each
core spell. Remember that these 0 SP effects are always available to
you, forming your baseline magical abilities that never run out.

#### Adapt Self - Basic Effect (0 SP)

| Property | Value |
|:---|:---|
| **Cast Time** | 1 Action |
| **Range** | Self |
| **Duration** | 1 minute |
| **Effect** | Gain one: +5 ft speed; OR Adv on Athletics (climb/swim); OR unarmed strikes deal 1d4 + Str mod damage. |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Arcane Sight - Basic Effect (0 SP)

| Property | Value |
|:---|:---|
| **Cast Time** | 1 Reaction |
| **Range** | Self (30 ft radius) |
| **Duration** | 1 minute |
| **Effect** | When you or an ally within 30 ft is hit by an attack OR targeted by a harmful spell or effect, you can use your Reaction to impose disadvantage on that triggering roll. |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Barrier - Basic Effect (0 SP)

### 5.6 Creativity in Action

The true power of this spell system emerges when you combine Spells,
Essences, and Enhancements to create unique magical effects that
perfectly suit the situation at hand.

> **Versatility Example: One Spell, Many Stories**
>
> *Kiran knows the `Barrier` spell with Earth Essence. Watch how his
> narrative shapes its use:*
>
> - *“I quickly raise my hand, pulling a small wall of stone from the
>   ground just in time to block the incoming arrows.” (Basic Effect, 0
>   SP)*
>
> - *“I concentrate on the ravine, envisioning a path across. With a
>   sweeping gesture, I pull stone from the cliff faces, shaping it into
>   a solid bridge.” (Shaped Barrier, 4 SP)*
>
> - *“You won’t escape! I slam my palm to the ground, and walls of earth
>   rise up around the thief, boxing him in as they follow my mental
>   command.” (Mobile Barrier + Expand Barrier, 6 SP)*
>
> - *“I brace against the wall and push with both hands. The stone
>   responds, thickening and spreading to completely seal the corridor
>   behind us.” (Standard Barrier + Fortify, 4 SP)*
>
> - *“I focus intensely, drawing up small platforms of magically
>   reinforced stone that hover just above the lava’s surface.” (Shaped
>   Barrier + Resilient Barrier, 5 SP)*
>
> *Same spell, different stories—limited only by creativity and SP.*

Remember that Modes and Enhancements for each spell are detailed in
Section 7: Enhancements. As you gain levels, you’ll learn more ways to
customize your spells, making your magical repertoire increasingly
versatile and powerful.

### 5.7 Class Unique Spells

## 6. Spell Points (SP)

Magic is fueled by **Spell Points (SP)**, representing a caster’s pool
of magical energy. Activating Spell **Modes** and adding
**Enhancements** costs SP.

### **6.1 Gaining and Spending SP**

- **SP Pool:** You have a maximum number of SP based on your character
  level, (your level + 1) \* 5. You regain all expended SP after
  completing a **Long Rest**.
- **Spending SP:** When you activate a Spell using one of its **Modes**
  (other than the 0 SP Basic Effect) or add **Enhancements**, you spend
  SP equal to the total cost. You cannot spend more SP than you
  currently have.

### **6.2 Basic Effects (0 SP)**

Each core Spell has a **Basic Effect** listed in Section 3.4 that costs
0 SP to use. These represent minor manifestations of the Spell’s concept
and can be used at will.

### **6.3 Maximum SP per Activation**

There is a limit to the total SP you can spend on a single activation of
a Spell (Base Mode Cost + Enhancement Costs). This limit prevents
characters from expending their entire energy pool on one overwhelmingly
powerful effect early on. This limit is based on your character level
your 2 + (level / 2) rounded up, as shown on Table 2-1.

### **6.4 Spell Point Progression**

#### Table 6-1: Spell Points and Maximum SP per Activation by Level\*\*

| Level | Spell Points | Max SP Per Activation |
|:------|:-------------|:----------------------|
| 1     | 10           | 3                     |
| 2     | 15           | 3                     |

## 7: Enhancements

### **7.1 Purpose of Enhancements**

**Enhancements** allow casters to spend **Spell Points (SP)** to augment
the **Basic Effect (0 SP)** of their known Spells. The most fundamental
Enhancement is the **Standard Activation Enhancement**, which unlocks
the Spell’s original core function at a specific SP cost. Further
Enhancements allow casters to scale a Spell’s effects (increasing
potency, scope, or duration), add new functions, or even alter how the
Spell is cast or resolved, typically building upon the Standard
Activation.

### **7.2 Learning and Using Enhancements**

#### Learning Enhancements & Modes

As you gain levels (Level 2+), your mastery of spells deepens. Each
level, you gain two opportunities to improve your magic. For each
opportunity, choose one spell you know and select either:

- One new **Mode** listed for that spell (such as Standard Mode or other
  available Modes)
- One new **Enhancement** listed for that spell

These opportunities can be used on the same spell or different spells,
in any combination.

> **Example:** At 3rd level, Lyra could learn the “Forceful Bolt”
> Enhancement and “Area Bolt” Mode for her Bolt spell, OR learn “Chain
> Bolt” Enhancement for Bolt and “Sensory Illusion” Mode for her
> Illusion spell.

#### Applying Enhancements

When activating a Spell, you can declare any learned Enhancements you
wish to apply. Add the SP cost of all applied Enhancements to the
Spell’s Base SP Cost. The total SP spent cannot exceed your Maximum SP
per Activation limit (see Table 6-1 in Section 6.4).

#### Combining Enhancements

Multiple *different* learned Enhancements can be applied to a single
Spell activation, provided their effects are not contradictory (e.g.,
you cannot apply two Enhancements that change the saving throw type to
different stats). The SP costs are cumulative.

### **7.3 Maximum SP per Activation**

To maintain balance across levels, there is a limit to the total number
of **Spell Points (SP)** (Base SP Cost + Enhancement SP Costs) that can
be spent on a single activation of any Spell. This limit typically
increases as a character gains levels. The specific progression will be
detailed on \[Table X-Y: Maximum SP per Activation\] (to be created
later, likely tied to class progression or caster level).
