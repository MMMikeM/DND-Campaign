## **6. Spell Points (SP)**

Magic is fueled by **Spell Points (SP)**, representing a caster's pool of magical energy. Activating Spell **Modes** and adding **Enhancements** costs SP.

### **6.1 Gaining and Spending SP**

- **SP Pool:** You have a maximum number of SP based on your character level, (your level + 1) * 5. You regain all expended SP after completing a **Long Rest**.
- **Spending SP:** When you activate a Spell using one of its **Modes** (other than the 0 SP Basic Effect) or add **Enhancements**, you spend SP equal to the total cost. You cannot spend more SP than you currently have.

### **6.2 Basic Effects (0 SP)**

Each core Spell has a **Basic Effect** listed in Section 3.4 that costs 0 SP to use. These represent minor manifestations of the Spell's concept and can be used at will.

### **6.3 Maximum SP per Activation**

There is a limit to the total SP you can spend on a single activation of a Spell (Base Mode Cost + Enhancement Costs). This limit prevents characters from expending their entire energy pool on one overwhelmingly powerful effect early on. This limit is based on your character level your 2 + (level / 2) rounded up, as shown on Table 2-1.

### **6.4 Spell Point Progression**
