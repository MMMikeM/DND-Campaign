## 1. Introduction

### **1.1 Welcome: Doing Cool Shit**

Welcome to a tabletop roleplaying game built from the ground up with one goal: **Empower you to do cool shit with as little friction as possible.** Forget dense rulebooks filled with exceptions and edge cases. This system is designed for dynamic, imaginative play where your character's unique abilities and your clever ideas take center stage.

This is a game about heroes wielding incredible power, shaped not just by rigid rules, but by their personality, history, and the fundamental magical **Essences** they command. You won't find sprawling spell lists here. Instead, you'll master core **Spells** – versatile templates representing fundamental magical concepts – and customize them on the fly with **Essences** and tactical **Enhancements**.

Want your energy blast to be a searing flame that pushes enemies back? A crackling bolt of lightning that chains between targets? A wave of chilling frost that slows them to a crawl? You can build that, expressing *your* character's specific brand of magic.

> **Magic in Action:** Lyra faces three charging goblins. "I slam my staff down and channel earth energy into a Blast!" She spends 2 SP for a standard Blast, adds Fire essence, and the Forceful enhancement (+1 SP). The goblins fail their saves and are pushed back by the wave of molten stone erupting from the ground – exactly the breathing room Lyra needed.

Get ready to weave compelling stories, face daunting challenges, and unleash your creativity.

### **1.2 Our Design Philosophy**

These rules are guided by a core set of principles aimed at creating the best possible play experience:

* **Narrative First:** The story you and your friends create together is paramount. Rules serve the story, providing structure for action and resolution, but should never stifle a great idea. Player inspiration drives the game.
* **Clarity:** Rules are written to be obvious and jargon-light. We aim for intuitive mechanics you can understand quickly and use confidently. No hidden traps or obscure interactions buried in footnotes.
* **Simplicity:** The core mechanics are designed to be lightweight and easy to grasp. While your magical effects can become complex and layered through Enhancements, the underlying system remains streamlined.
* **Versatility:** The magic system (Spells + Essences + Enhancements) is modular. Mix and match components to create the precise effects you envision, when you need them.
* **Fun:** Every choice should feel meaningful and exciting. Your character's abilities are tools designed to spark clever tactics and rewarding moments, not bog down the game.
* **Creativity:** Mechanics should be a launchpad for imagination, not a straitjacket. This system encourages you to describe *how* your character's magic looks, feels, and manifests, celebrating unique flair over rote recitation.
* **Balance:** We aim for earned power and fair challenges. Choices should be meaningful, without obvious "best" options or game-breaking combos. Every character path should feel viable and rewarding.
* **Clean Design:** We've avoided legacy bloat and unnecessary complexity. This is a refined, streamlined system focused on doing its job elegantly.

> ✨ **Our Golden Rule:**  
> If a rule ever blocks a great idea or feels too complicated for the fun it provides, we tweak the rule—not the idea.  
> **If it isn't fun, it isn't right.**

### **1.3 What You Need to Play**

To play, you'll need a few things:

* **Friends:** Typically one **Game Master (GM)** to guide the story and adjudicate rules, and 2-5 **Players** portraying their characters.
* **Dice:** A standard set of polyhedral dice (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20) is recommended for each player.
* **Character Sheets:** To record your character's details (a template may be provided separately).
* **Pencils & Paper:** For notes, mapping, and tracking temporary effects.
* **Imagination:** The most crucial component!

### **1.4 How to Use These Rules**

This book is structured to get you playing quickly:

1. **Section 2: Forging Your Character:** This is your starting point. It guides you step-by-step through creating your unique hero, from initial concept to final details.
2. **Sections 3-7:** These sections detail the core mechanics underpinning your character's abilities – Classes, Essences, Spells, Spell Points, and Enhancements. You'll reference these during character creation and throughout play.

Don't feel you need to memorize everything upfront. To start, you only need the following:

* Your character (Section 2)
* The basics of their Class (Section 3)
* Your two selected Essences (Section 4)
* Your four selected Spells (Section 5)

Spell Points (Section 6) and Enhancements (Section 7) will become relevant as you progress through the game.

Now, gather your dice, spark your imagination, and let's forge a hero! Turn to **Section 2: Forging Your Character** to begin.
