## 4: Essences

### **4.1 Defining Essences**

**Essences** are the fundamental magical energies that shape your spells, manifesting as crackling electricity, devouring shadows, or verdant growth. They are the essential flavor and specific manifestation applied to a generic **Spell** when it is activated – the difference between a generic *Bolt* Spell and a scorching *Fire Bolt*, a crackling *Lightning Bolt*, or a debilitating *Necrotic Ray*. Essences bridge the gap between the abstract mechanical framework of a Spell and the evocative, descriptive magic seen in play. They provide:

- **Sensory Description:** How the Spell looks, sounds, smells, feels.
- **Thematic Grounding:** Connects the Spell to the caster's style (arcane formulas, divine prayers, primal calls, psionic focus).
- **Mechanical Hooks:** Determines damage type and provides links for potential status effects via **Enhancements**.

### **4.2 Choosing Essences**

Characters learn Essences based primarily on their chosen magical path and training.

- **Learning Essence Descriptors:** When a character first gains access to **Spells** (typically at 1st level or through multiclassing), they choose **two Essence Descriptors** (from the list in 4.5) that fit their character concept. Additional Descriptors might be learned through feats, or specific cases when granted by a GM.
- **Descriptor Knowledge:** Knowing an Essence Descriptor (e.g., "Fire") means you can apply its theme, associated damage type, and minor effects to any Spell you activate where it makes narrative sense.

### **4.3 Applying Essences**

When activating a **Spell**, the caster chooses **one** known **Essence Descriptor** to apply. This choice primarily dictates the Spell's sensory details and damage type.

- **Flavor First:** The primary role of applying an Essence is descriptive. It determines *how* the Spell manifests. For example, applying a "Fire" Essence to the *Heal* Spell wouldn't cause burning damage; instead, it might manifest as warm, soothing flames that knit wounds closed, or a comforting heat that revitalizes the target. The Spell's core mechanical function (restoring Hit Points) remains unchanged.
  - **Describing Your Magic:** The mechanics tell what your essence does, but **you** decide how it looks, sounds, and feels. A Fire spell might manifest as dancing embers, a concentrated beam of heat, or an explosion of ash and cinders – the choice is yours! Let your creativity define your magic's unique signature.
- **Narrative Consistency:** While flexible, the chosen Essence should generally align with the Spell's intended effect. Applying an Essence whose fundamental nature contradicts the Spell's core function usually doesn't make sense. For example, describing a *Heal* Spell using the "Necrotic" Essence (associated with decay and undeath) would likely be inappropriate for restoring life energy to a living creature. The GM helps ensure descriptions remain coherent within the established fiction.
- **No Base Cost:** Applying a basic Essence Descriptor does not increase the **SP** cost of activating the Spell.

### **4.4 Mechanical Impact of Essences**

While primarily descriptive, Essences have key mechanical implications:

- **Damage Type:** For Spells that deal damage, the chosen Essence Descriptor *becomes* the damage type (e.g., Fire damage, Cold damage, Life damage, Necrotic damage). Resistance and vulnerability function based on these Essence types. *(Optional Rule: For tables preferring standard 5e damage types, a mapping can be used where each Essence corresponds to a similar 5e type).*
- **Status Effect Association:** Base Essences do not automatically impose conditions. However, each Essence Descriptor is linked to a specific **composite status effect** (detailed in the table in Section 4.5). These associations serve as hooks for **Enhancements** (Section 5), which may allow a caster to spend additional **SP** (typically +2 SP, though class features might modify this) to add the Essence's associated status effect to a Spell.
- **Minor Inherent Effects:** Essences provide minor, flavorful, non-combat effects related to their nature (summarized alongside each Essence in Section 4.5, like Fire igniting objects or Cold chilling surfaces). These should be used for descriptive color and minor narrative advantages, not significant mechanical benefits without specific **Enhancements**.
- **Skill Interactions:** The description of an Essence might occasionally grant circumstantial benefits relevant to skills (e.g., an *Illusion* Spell with a convincing "Shadow" Essence might aid Stealth). This is situational and adjudicated by the GM.
- **Component Interaction:** The default Verbal (V) and Focus (M) components required for Spells are generally unchanged by Essences.

### **4.5 Essence Descriptors**

Each Essence represents a fundamental type of magical energy or substance, bringing unique flavor and mechanical effects to your spells. Remember that beyond the listed mechanics, you are encouraged to describe the specific visual, auditory, and sensory details of how *your* character manifests these Essences.

> Choose one known Essence whenever you cast a spell to determine its damage type (if any) and potentially apply its linked status effect using Enhancements.

#### Using the status in play

- Add the Essence’s *damage type* for free when casting a spell that deals damage.
- To **inflict the associated status effect**, you typically spend **+2 SP** when casting the spell (using an Enhancement that allows this) OR use a specific class feature or Mode that applies the status.
- Unless specified otherwise by the spell Mode or Enhancement, status effects applied this way last until the **start of your next turn**.

*Example:*
> [GM] *"The ogre towers ahead of you, its tough skin gives it an AC of 16"*
>
> My storm mage channels crackling energy between her fingertips. 'You'll regret that!' I cast **Lightning Bolt** with the Debilitating enhancement for 4 SP total.
>
> *[Rolls attack dice]* That's a 17!
>
> The bolt strikes true, arcing across the battlefield with a thunderous crack!
>
> The ogre takes 3d8 lightning damage *[rolls]* for 13 damage. As electricity courses through its body, it becomes **Conductive** - its muscles spasm, making attacks difficult and its skin crackles with residual energy that will amplify the next hit it takes.
>
> [GM] "*The ogre roars in pain as lightning dances across its body. It's now Conductive until the start of your next turn."*
