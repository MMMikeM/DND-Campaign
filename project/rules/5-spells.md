# 5. Spells: The Frameworks of Magic

> *"A mage who knows a hundred specific spells is limited. A mage who masters a dozen fundamental magical concepts and can adapt them endlessly? They are truly powerful."*

## 5.1 The Nature of Spells

In this system, **Spells** are foundational magical concepts—versatile templates that represent core magical effects like projecting energy, healing wounds, or creating barriers. Unlike traditional systems with sprawling spell lists, we focus on a curated set of core spells that you'll personalize through **Essences** and **Enhancements**.

Think of Spells as the underlying structure of your magic:

* **Spells** define *what* your magic does (damage, healing, movement)
* **Essences** determine *how* your magic manifests (fire, lightning, shadow)
* **Enhancements** control *how powerful* your effects become

This modular approach shifts the focus from memorizing numerous specific rules to mastering a core framework that you can creatively adapt to any situation. Your character isn't limited by a static list of predetermined effects—they're empowered to shape their magic according to their needs and style.

> **Magic in Action: Narrative Drives Mechanics**
>
> *Standing at the edge of a chasm, Lyra plants her feet firmly and extends her hands.*
>
> *"I focus my power, drawing stone from the surrounding earth to form a solid bridge across the gap," she declares.*
>
> *The ground trembles as rock and earth rise up, twisting and compacting into a sturdy stone bridge that spans the fifteen-foot gap.*
>
> **Behind the Magic:** Lyra used her `Barrier` spell with **Earth Essence**, choosing the "Shaped Barrier" mode (4 SP) and adding the "Expand Barrier" enhancement (+1 SP) to create a structure large enough to cross safely.
>
> *Later, in combat, Lyra reacts differently to danger:*
>
> *"I slam my staff down!" Lyra shouts as enemy archers take aim. "A wall of shimmering golden light springs up between us and the archers!"*
>
> *A translucent barrier of radiant energy materializes, arrows thudding harmlessly against its surface.*
>
> **Behind the Magic:** Same spell (`Barrier`), different execution—this time with **Light Essence** and the simpler "Standard Barrier" mode (2 SP) for a quick defensive reaction.

## 5.2 Learning Spells

Characters **know** a set number of Spells, representing the magical effects they have mastered. Unlike some systems, you don't prepare spells daily—your known spells are always available to you.

Your four starting spells form the core of your magical repertoire, representing the foundational concepts your character has mastered.
Character progression primarily focuses on enhancing these core spells through Spell Points and Enhancements (see Section 7).
While your character may rarely learn entirely new spells through specific feats or unique narrative opportunities, the emphasis of this system is on deepening mastery over breadth of effects.

### Starting Spells

At 1st level, you know **four Spells** determined as follows:

* Your class grants you a **Core Attack Spell** (`Strike` or `Bolt`, or sometimes a choice between them)
* Your class grants you a **Unique Thematic Spell** that only your class can access
* You **choose two** additional spells from your class's specific list of **Available Spells**

> **✨ Tip: Complementary Choices**
>
> When choosing your two additional spells, consider how they'll complement your core and unique spells. Look for options that cover different situations (combat, exploration, social) or fill different roles (offense, defense, utility).

### Changing Known Spells

Every 4th level (4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, 20th), when you would normally gain a Feat, you can replace one spell you know with a different spell from your class spell list, representing your character's evolving magical approach.

## 5.3 Spell Descriptions

Each spell follows a standard format detailing its core function before any Enhancements are applied:

| Element          | Description                                                                                                                                                                        |
|:-----------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Name**         | The generic name representing the spell's core concept                                                                                                                             |
| **Casting Time** | Action required (1 Action, Reaction, Special)                                                                                                                                      |
| **Range**        | Maximum distance (Self, Touch, 30 feet, etc.)                                                                                                                                      |
| **Components**   | By default, all spells require **V** (Verbal) and **M** (Focus) components. **S** (Somatic) is listed only if additional intricate gestures are required beyond handling the focus |
| **Duration**     | How long the effect lasts (Instantaneous, 1 round, Concentration up to X)                                                                                                          |
| **Core Effect**  | Description of what happens when activating the spell at its Base SP Cost                                                                                                          |
| **Tags**         | Optional keywords like **Concentration** or **Ritual**                                                                                                                             |

### Component Notes

* **Verbal (V)** - Spoken words, incantations, or sounds. You must be able to speak to fulfill a Verbal component.
* **Material (M)** - A focus that channels your magic (wand, staff, crystal, etc.). You must be holding the focus to fulfill a Material component. The hand holding the focus is typically sufficient for any gestures required by the spell.
* **Somatic (S)** - Complex hand gestures beyond simply pointing your focus

### Common Tags

* **Concentration** - Requires maintaining focus; you can only concentrate on one spell at a time
* **Ritual** - Can be cast taking 10 minutes longer without spending SP (only for spells with this tag)

## 5.4 Understanding Spell Effects

Each spell has a **Basic Effect** (0 SP) that you can use at will, similar to a cantrip. This represents the most fundamental application of the magical concept.

By spending **Spell Points (SP)**, you can activate more powerful **Modes** of the spell or add **Enhancements** (see Section 7) that modify its effects. **Modes** are specific predefined ways to use a spell, while **Enhancements** are customized modifications.

> **Example: Building on Basics**
>
> *"I point my finger at the cultist, and a thin streak of flame darts from my fingertip!"*
>
> *This is the `Bolt` spell's **Basic Effect** (0 SP) with Fire Essence, a simple but effective attack.*
>
> *"I channel my power and unleash a blazing fireball that streaks toward the cultist leader!"*
>
> *By spending 2 SP for the "Standard Bolt" **Mode**, the mage creates a more powerful attack (3d8 damage).*
>
> *"I focus intently, launching a bolt of lightning that arcs from the troll to its nearby ally!"*
>
> *Adding the "Chain Bolt" **Enhancement** (+2 SP, total 4 SP) creates a bolt that jumps to a second target after hitting the first.*

>
> * *"I concentrate on the ravine, envisioning a path across. With a sweeping gesture, I pull stone from the cliff faces, shaping it into a solid bridge." (Shaped Barrier, 4 SP)*
>
> * *"You won't escape! I slam my palm to the ground, and walls of earth rise up around the thief, boxing him in as they follow my mental command." (Mobile Barrier + Expand Barrier, 6 SP)*

> * *"I brace against the wall and push with both hands. The stone responds, thickening and spreading to completely seal the corridor behind us." (Standard Barrier + Fortify, 4 SP)*
>
> * *"I focus intensely, drawing up small platforms of magically reinforced stone that hover just above the lava's surface." (Shaped Barrier + Resilient Barrier, 5 SP)*
