## 2. Forging Your Character

Character creation isn't about filling out a form—it's about crafting someone you're excited to be. This section walks you through breathing life into a hero whose story you want to tell, following a path from core concept to the fine details.

### 2.1 The Spark: Your Concept

Before touching dice or numbers, envision who your character is at their core. What drives them? What makes them memorable? Consider:

- **What's their story?** A village healer who whispers to spirits? A former soldier with nothing left to lose? A street-smart hustler who learned magic by accident?
- **What's their approach to problems?** Bold confrontation? Clever misdirection? Careful observation? Inspiring leadership?
- **What sets them apart?** Unusual talents? A distinctive appearance? A unique perspective shaped by their past?

> **Quick Concept Builder**: Pick one option from each table (or roll a d6 for each) to jumpstart your character concept:

#### **Table 1: Background**

| d6 | Background            |
|:--:|:----------------------|
| 1  | Disgraced noble       |
| 2  | Former cultist        |
| 3  | Wilderness survivor   |
| 4  | Guild‑trained artisan |
| 5  | Street criminal       |
| 6  | Accidental hero       |

#### **Table 2: Motivation**

| d6 | Motivation |
|:--:|:-----------|
| 1  | Revenge    |
| 2  | Redemption |
| 3  | Discovery  |
| 4  | Protection |
| 5  | Ambition   |
| 6  | Legacy     |

#### **Table 3: Temperament**

| d6 | Temperament |
|:--:|:------------|
| 1  | Calculated  |
| 2  | Impulsive   |
| 3  | Stoic       |
| 4  | Curious     |
| 5  | Passionate  |
| 6  | Cautious    |

#### **Table 4: Approach**

| d6 | Approach               |
|:--:|:-----------------------|
| 1  | Scholarly analysis     |
| 2  | Brute force            |
| 3  | Social manipulation    |
| 4  | Intuitive instinct     |
| 5  | Adaptive improvisation |
| 6  | Meticulous planning    |

### 2.2 Defining Capabilities: Ability Scores

Your character's natural talents are represented by six core abilities. These modifiers will affect nearly every roll you make. Assign each modifier from this set to one ability score:

    **+3, +2, +1, +0, +0, -1**

- **Strength (Str)**: Physical power and athletic capability
- **Dexterity (Dex)**: Agility, reflexes, and coordination
- **Constitution (Con)**: Endurance, vitality, and resilience
- **Intelligence (Int)**: Reasoning, memory, and knowledge
- **Wisdom (Wis)**: Perception, intuition, and awareness
- **Charisma (Cha)**: Personal magnetism and force of will

> **Embracing Specialization**: Every hero has strengths and weaknesses—that's what makes them interesting! Your +3 represents what you excel at, while your -1 is an opportunity for memorable roleplaying and creative problem-solving. A brilliant scholar might struggle to lift heavy objects. A mighty champion might miss social cues. These contrasts create depth and encourage teamwork.

Think about your Concept. Which ability best represents their primary strength? This ability will often align with the **Key Ability** of the Class you choose in Step 2.4. Assign your **+3** there, then distribute the remaining modifiers to reflect their other talents and limitations.

### 2.3 Roots: Forge Your Background

Your background is who you were *before* adventure called. It shaped your skills and connections. Instead of rigid categories, define your background by selecting:

1. **Two Skill Proficiencies:** Choose **two** skills from the table below to gain +3 to checks made with that skill. Choose skills that reflect your past experiences.
2. **A Story Hook:** Create a connection to the world that your GM can use to draw you into adventures. This is a narrative benefit, not a mechanical one. Examples:
  
    - "I have contacts in the thieves' guild who still owe me favors."
    - "The remote monastery where I trained still seeks my counsel."
    - "My family name opens doors in certain noble circles."
    - "I know secret routes through the wilderness few others have mapped."

**Skill Proficiencies:**

| Str       | Dex             | Int           | Wis             | Cha          | Con      |
|:----------|:----------------|:--------------|:----------------|:-------------|:---------|
| Athletics | Acrobatics      | Arcana        | Animal Handling | Deception    | *(None)* |
|           | Sleight of Hand | History       | Insight         | Intimidation |          |
|           | Stealth         | Investigation | Medicine        | Performance  |          |
|           |                 | Nature        | Perception      | Persuasion   |          |
|           |                 | Religion      | Survival        |              |          |

### 2.4 Defining Your Path: Choose Your Class

Your Class defines *how* your character channels magical power and approaches challenges. It provides your core archetype and mechanical framework.

1. **Review the Classes:** Read through the descriptions in **Section 3: Classes**. Pay attention to the **Key Ability** score – ideally, this should match the ability where you placed your +3 modifier in Step 2.2. Choose the Class that best fits your Character Concept.
2. **Note Your Class Benefits:** Your chosen class determines:
    - Your **Key Ability** score
    - Your **Unique Spell** (that only your class can access)
    - Your **Hit Die** (for calculating HP)
    - Your **Proficiencies** in armor, weapons, and saving throws

**Classes at a Glance:**

| Class     | Key Ability  | Unique Spell | Hit Die | Archetype                         |
|:----------|:-------------|:-------------|:--------|:----------------------------------|
| Champion  | Strength     | Barrier      | d10     | Protector, mighty warrior         |
| Trickster | Dexterity    | Move         | d8      | Swift, cunning combatant          |
| Adapter   | Constitution | Adapt Self   | d10     | Resilient, shapeshifting survivor |
| Scholar   | Intelligence | Manipulate   | d6      | Brilliant, calculated caster      |
| Sage      | Wisdom       | Arcane Sight | d8      | Perceptive, intuitive guide       |
| Orator    | Charisma     | Influence    | d8      | Compelling, force of personality  |

### 2.5 Shaping Your Magic: Choose Essences

**Essences** define the *look, feel, and damage type* of your magic, bridging the gap between mechanical framework and your character's unique expression. Refer to **Section 4: Essences** for the full list and details.

- **Choose Two Essence Descriptors:** Select **two** Essences from the list in Section 4.5 (e.g., Fire, Shadow, Life, Psychic).
- **Reflect Your Concept & Class:** These choices should strongly tie into your Character Concept and Class. How does *your* character's magic manifest?

**Essence Inspiration Examples:**

- A Champion who served as a lighthouse keeper might choose **Light** and **Force**, manifesting shields of blinding energy.
- A Trickster raised among thieves might choose **Shadow** and **Sound**, creating diversions and illusions.
- A Sage who survived in the wilderness might choose **Life** and **Earth**, channeling primal nature forces.
- An Adapter with a mysterious bloodline might choose **Fire** and **Lightning**, their body crackling with inherited power.
- A Scholar obsessed with cosmic mysteries might choose **Psychic** and **Cold**, drawing power from the void between stars.
- An Orator with a musical background might choose **Sound** and **Light**, weaving performances into magic.

When you activate a Spell, you'll choose *one* of your known Essences to apply, determining its damage type and descriptive flavor.

### 2.6 Mastering Effects: Selecting Spells

Your Class grants you access to **Spells** – the fundamental templates for your magical effects. At 1st level, you **know four Spells** that you can use freely without daily preparation.

Refer to your chosen Class description in **Section 3.3** to determine your starting spells:

1. **Core Attack Spell:** Your class grants you knowledge of `Strike`, `Bolt`, or lets you choose one.
2. **Unique Thematic Spell:** Your class grants you knowledge of a specific mandatory Spell central to its theme (your Unique Spell from 2.4).
3. **Choice Spells (Choose 2):** Your class provides a list of **Available Spells**. Choose **two** additional Spells from that list.

Record your four starting Spells and familiarize yourself with their **Basic Effects** (0 SP cost) listed in Section 5.4. These 0 SP effects are always available to you, forming your baseline magical abilities.

### 2.7 Adding Depth: Your Hindrance

Compelling heroes have flaws. Your hindrance is a significant weakness or complication that occasionally creates trouble—but also adds depth and roleplaying opportunities.

When your hindrance meaningfully complicates things during play or inspires a creative narrative, the GM may award a **Fate Undo Token** (typically when the hindrance creates a genuine obstacle).

**Fate Undo Tokens** represent your character's ability to persevere despite their limitations and allow you to:

- Undo your last roll
- Undo a roll against you
- Undo your last narrative action

Create your own hindrance or use these as inspiration:

**Personality Hindrances:**

- **Code-Bound**: You follow principles that sometimes limit your options.
- **Impulsive**: You act before thinking when emotions run high.
- **Skeptical**: You distrust what others accept, sometimes to your detriment.
- **Stubbornly Independent**: You refuse help even when you need it.

**Physical Hindrances:**

- **Old Injury**: A permanent wound sometimes flares up at the worst moments.
- **Sensory Limitation**: Partial deafness, colorblindness, or other sensory impairment.
- **Recognizable Mark**: A distinctive appearance makes you easy to identify and remember.
- **Chronic Condition**: An illness or condition that requires management and occasionally worsens.

**Social Hindrances:**

- **Notorious Reputation**: Your name or face is associated with events you may or may not be responsible for.
- **Outsider**: Your origins or appearance mark you as different in most communities.
- **Obligation**: A debt, duty, or commitment that pulls you away at inconvenient times.
- **Nemesis**: Someone powerful holds a grudge against you and actively works against you.

**Supernatural Hindrances:**

- **Haunted**: Spirits, memories, or actual ghosts follow you.
- **Magical Resonance**: Your presence triggers unpredictable minor magical effects.
- **Marked by Power**: Your connection to magic is visible and potentially alarming to others.
- **Cosmic Attention**: Something beyond mortal understanding has noticed you.

### 2.8 Calculating Vitality: Hit Points (HP)

Your Hit Points determine how much punishment you can take before falling unconscious.

- **Starting HP at 1st Level:** `Maximum value of your Class Hit Die + your Constitution modifier`
  - *Example:* A Champion (d10 Hit Die) with a +1 Constitution modifier starts with 10 + 1 = 11 HP.
  - *Example:* A Scholar (d6 Hit Die) with a +0 Constitution modifier starts with 6 + 0 = 6 HP.
- **HP Gain on Level Up:** When you gain a level after 1st, you gain additional HP equal to:
  - `Half your class hit die rounded up (d6=3, d8=4, d10=5, d12=6) + your Constitution modifier`

Record your starting HP.

### 2.9 Future Growth: Understanding Enhancements & Spell Points

As you gain experience, you'll unlock more powerful and versatile magical abilities through **Enhancements** and expendable **Spell Points (SP)**.

- **Spell Points (SP):** Your magical energy pool. At 1st level, you have 10 SP, scaling with your level (see Section 6.4). You regain all SP after a Long Rest.
- **Basic Effects (0 SP):** Each spell has a Basic Effect that costs 0 SP, usable at will (like cantrips).
- **Enhancements:** As you level up, you'll learn Enhancements that let you spend SP to augment your spells in creative ways.
- **Maximum SP per Activation:** At 1st level, you can spend a maximum of 3 SP on a single spell activation. This limit increases as you gain levels (see Section 6.4).

**Learning Your First Enhancement:**
At 1st level, you know one Enhancement for one of your spells. Choose one spell you know, then work with your GM to define one Enhancement for that spell, following the guidelines in Section 7. This Enhancement represents your initial specialization and creative approach to magic.

### 2.10 The Final Flourishes

Fill in the remaining details that bring your character fully to life:

- **Name**: What are you called? Does your name have meaning or history?
- **Appearance**: What immediately stands out? Any distinctive features or style?
- **Personality:** Briefly note key traits, ideals, and bonds.

**Anchors & Questions:**
Two special elements add depth and drive to your character:

- **Anchor**: What keeps you grounded when everything else fails? This could be:
  - *A memento:* "My father's broken sword reminds me why I fight."
  - *A promise:* "I swore to return to my village with the cure."
  - *A person:* "My sister depends on me; I can't fail her."
  - *A principle:* "Justice must prevail, even when mercy cannot."

- **Question**: What unresolved mystery drives you forward? This could be:
  - *Personal:* "Who killed my mentor, and why?"
  - *Cosmic:* "What lies beyond the veil between worlds?"
  - *Identity:* "Am I truly the last of my kind?"
  - *Purpose:* "What is my magic truly capable of?"
