## 2 Character Creation Guide: Forging Your Hero

Welcome to a world where your magical identity is shaped not by rigid spell lists, but by your character's unique story and style. This guide walks you through creating someone you're excited to play—focusing on narrative first, with mechanics that support your vision.

### 2.1 The Spark: Your Character Concept

Before touching dice or numbers, envision who your character is at their core:

- **What's their story?** A village healer who whispers to spirits? A former soldier with nothing left to lose? A street criminal who discovered magic by accident?
- **What's their approach to problems?** Bold confrontation? Clever misdirection? Careful analysis? Inspiring leadership?
- **What sets them apart?** Unusual talents? A distinctive appearance? A unique magical style?

> **Example Concept:** Thorne was once a respected temple guardian before his reckless pursuit of power led to the shrine's destruction. Now he channels earth essence through disciplined martial forms, seeking redemption by protecting others—even as the ghosts of his past haunt his dreams.

**Need Inspiration?** Roll a d6 on each table or pick one option from each to generate a foundation for your character:

| Background (d6)        | Motivation (d6) | Temperament (d6) | Approach (d6)             |
|:-----------------------|:----------------|:-----------------|:--------------------------|
| 1. Disgraced noble     | 1. Revenge      | 1. Calculated    | 1. Scholarly analysis     |
| 2. Former cultist      | 2. Redemption   | 2. Impulsive     | 2. Brute force            |
| 3. Wilderness survivor | 3. Discovery    | 3. Stoic         | 3. Social manipulation    |
| 4. Guild artisan       | 4. Protection   | 4. Curious       | 4. Intuitive instinct     |
| 5. Street criminal     | 5. Ambition     | 5. Passionate    | 5. Adaptive improvisation |
| 6. Accidental hero     | 6. Legacy       | 6. Cautious      | 6. Meticulous planning    |

> **Concept Example:** Rolling 4-2-5-3 gives a guild artisan motivated by redemption with a passionate temperament who approaches problems through social manipulation; perhaps a silver-tongued former jeweler who betrayed their guild and now uses manipulation magic to make amends.

### 2.2 Choosing Your Class

Your Class defines *how* your character channels magical power and approaches challenges. It provides your core archetype and mechanical framework.

**Classes at a Glance:**

| Class     | Key Ability  | Unique Spell | Hit Die | Archetype                         |
|:----------|:-------------|:-------------|:--------|:----------------------------------|
| Champion  | Strength     | Barrier      | d10     | Protector, mighty warrior         |
| Trickster | Dexterity    | Move         | d8      | Swift, cunning combatant          |
| Adapter   | Constitution | Adapt Self   | d10     | Resilient, shapeshifting survivor |
| Scholar   | Intelligence | Manipulate   | d6      | Brilliant, calculated caster      |
| Sage      | Wisdom       | Arcane Sight | d8      | Perceptive, intuitive guide       |
| Orator    | Charisma     | Influence    | d8      | Compelling, force of personality  |

Each class provides:

- A **Key Ability** that powers your magic
- A unique **Spell** only your class can access
- **Hit Die** type determining your health
- **Proficiencies** in armor, weapons, and saving throws

**Class Flavor Examples:**

**Champion:** *Kendra slams her warhammer into the ground, channeling earth essence. A wall of stone erupts before her, shielding her companions from the dragon's breath. "Stand behind me!" she commands, her magical barriers as unyielding as her resolve.*

**Trickster:** *Vex winks at her pursuer before stepping into a shadow and seemingly vanishing. A heartbeat later, she materializes behind the guards, already halfway down the corridor. "Better luck next time, gentlemen," she calls back, tossing their stolen keys playfully.*

**Adapter:** *Cornered by the patrol, Kira closes her eyes and takes a deep breath. When she opens them, her skin has taken on the mottled gray of stone, her hands have transformed into jagged claws. "You really don't want this fight," she growls.*

**Scholar:** *As the lock mechanism activates, Elara quickly traces intricate geometric symbols. "The pattern suggests a quaternary sequence," she murmurs, as components begin to float apart in midair, rearranged by her telekinetic precision.*

**Sage:** *As the party debates their next move, Orrin closes his eyes and extends his awareness beyond physical sight. "Wait," he says quietly. "There's a presence here that doesn't belong to this time... and it's watching us right now."*

**Orator:** *When negotiations begin to collapse, Lyria steps forward, her voice resonating with subtle harmonics. "Perhaps we've been looking at this all wrong," she suggests, her words carrying an almost tangible weight as the hostile delegates find themselves nodding along.*

> **Selection Tip:** Choose a class that aligns with your character concept and whose Key Ability you want to excel in.

### 2.3 Defining Your Abilities

Abilities represent your character's natural talents. In this system, we use **ability modifiers** (ranging from -1 to +3) to represent these talents:

| Ability                | Description                               | What It Represents                              |
|:-----------------------|:------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------|
| **Strength (Str)**     | Physical power and athletic capability    | Lifting, melee attacks, breaking objects        |
| **Dexterity (Dex)**    | Agility, reflexes and precision           | Balance, stealth, ranged attacks, reaction time |
| **Constitution (Con)** | Endurance, vitality, resilience           | Health, stamina, resistance to poison/disease   |
| **Intelligence (Int)** | Reasoning, knowledge                      | Problem-solving, recall, academic knowledge     |
| **Wisdom (Wis)**       | Perception, intuition, awareness          | Noticing details, reading situations, willpower |
| **Charisma (Cha)**     | Personal magnetism, force of will         | Social influence, leadership, performance       |

**Ability Modifier Scale:**

- **+3**: Exceptional talent, among the best in the world
- **+2**: Remarkable aptitude, well above average
- **+1**: Above average capability
- **+0**: Average human capability
- **-1**: Below average, a notable weakness

> **Specialization Creates Depth:** A brilliant scholar might struggle to lift heavy objects. A mighty champion might miss social cues. These contrasts create interesting narrative opportunities and encourage teamwork.

**Assign these modifiers to your abilities:**
`+3, +2, +1, +0, +0, -1`

**Recommended Distribution:**

1. Assign your **+3** to your class's **Key Ability**
2. Distribute remaining modifiers to reflect your character's other talents and weaknesses

**Example Distribution:** *Thorne the Champion assigns +3 to Strength (his Key Ability), +2 to Constitution (for endurance), +1 to Charisma (natural leadership), +0 to Wisdom and Dexterity, and -1 to Intelligence (he's never been one for book learning).*

### 2.4 Core Mechanics

#### Proficiency Bonus

This system uses a fixed **Proficiency Bonus (+3)** regardless of character level, emphasizing ability selection and specialization over level scaling.

#### Skill Proficiencies

Choose **two skills** from this list to gain proficiency. When making a skill check, add your ability modifier (and proficiency bonus if proficient) to a d20 roll.

| Str       | Dex             | Int           | Wis             | Cha          | Con      |
|:----------|:----------------|:--------------|:----------------|:-------------|:---------|
| Athletics | Acrobatics      | Arcana        | Animal Handling | Deception    | *(None)* |
|           | Sleight of Hand | History       | Insight         | Intimidation |          |
|           | Stealth         | Investigation | Medicine        | Performance  |          |
|           |                 | Nature        | Perception      | Persuasion   |          |
|           |                 | Religion      | Survival        |              |          |

**Skill Check Formula:** `1d20 + Ability Modifier + Proficiency Bonus (if proficient)`

**Example:** *Thorne the Champion has Athletics proficiency and Strength +3. When climbing a cliff, he rolls: 1d20 + 3 (Strength) + 3 (Proficiency) = 1d20 + 6*

#### Saving Throws

Your class grants proficiency in two saving throws:

- **Champion:** Strength, Constitution
- **Trickster:** Dexterity, Intelligence
- **Adapter:** Constitution, Wisdom
- **Scholar:** Intelligence, Wisdom
- **Sage:** Wisdom, Charisma
- **Orator:** Charisma, Dexterity

**Saving Throw Formula:** `1d20 + Ability Modifier + Proficiency Bonus (if proficient)`

**Example:** *Thorne must resist a mind-affecting spell with a Wisdom save. He rolls: 1d20 + 0 (Wisdom) + 0 (not proficient) = 1d20 + 0*

#### Spellcasting

Your **Spellcasting Ability Modifier** (Spell Mod) is the modifier from your class's Key Ability.

- **Spell Attack Bonus = Your Spellcasting Ability Modifier**
- **Spell Save DC = 10 + Your Spellcasting Ability Modifier**

**Example:** *Thorne has Strength +3 as his Key Ability. His Spell Attack Bonus is +3, and his Spell Save DC is 13.*

### 2.5 Shaping Your Magic

#### Choose Essences

**Essences** define how your magic looks, feels, and what damage type it deals.

1. **Choose Two Essence Descriptors** from: Fire, Cold, Life, Necrotic, Light, Shadow, Lightning, Earth, Psychic, Force, Sound, Toxic
2. **Match to Your Concept:** Your essences should reflect your character's story and approach to magic

**Essence Examples in Play:**

- A Champion who served as a lighthouse keeper might choose **Light** and **Force**, manifesting shields of blinding energy
- A Trickster raised among thieves might choose **Shadow** and **Sound**, creating diversions and illusions
- A Sage who survived in the wilderness might choose **Life** and **Earth**, channeling primal nature forces

Each time you cast a spell, you choose which of your two essences to apply, determining both its damage type and how it manifests in the world.

#### Select Spells

Your Class grants you four **Base Spells**:

1. **Core Attack Spell:** Your primary offensive option (`Strike`, `Bolt`, or a choice between them)
2. **Unique Spell:** A distinctive spell that only your class can access
3. **Choice Spells:** Select **two** additional spells from your class's available options

Record your spells and their **Basic Effects** (0 SP cost)—these 0 SP effects are always available to you.

**Spell Examples:**

- **Strike (Basic, 0 SP):** *Making a weapon attack that deals extra essence damage equal to your Spell Mod. "My axe glows with earth energy as I swing it at the orc!"*

- **Bolt (Basic, 0 SP):** *Firing a ranged magical attack that deals 1d10 essence damage. "I launch a streak of shadow energy at the distant archer!"*

- **Barrier (Basic, 0 SP):** *Creating a 5x5 ft plane of energy that provides half cover. "I quickly raise a small wall of stone to shield myself from the arrows!"*

- **Heal (Basic, 0 SP):** *Restoring 1d4 + Spell Mod hit points to a touched creature. "I place my hands on your wound, channeling life essence to knit the flesh."*

### 2.6 Adding Character Depth

#### Your Hindrance

Every hero has a weakness or complication that adds depth and creates dramatic opportunities. This is your **Hindrance**.

Your Hindrance occasionally creates trouble for your character. When it causes a **Meaningful Complication** during play, the GM may award you a **Fate Undo Token**.

##### Meaningful Complication

A **Meaningful Complication** is an instance where your Hindrance directly creates a significant obstacle or difficulty that impacts the unfolding scene or challenges your character's immediate goals.

It should:

- Create a genuine obstacle or limitation
- Force difficult choices
- Change the course of action your character would have taken otherwise
- Have consequences beyond a single failed roll

While your hindrance can enrich the description of your character's struggle without concrete impact on the situation is generally *not* a Meaningful Complication.

##### Fate Undo Token

When awarded a Fate Undo Token, you can spend it at any point of your choosing to trigger one of the following effects:

- **Undo your last action:** Reroll your last d20 roll and choose which result to use.
- **Undo target's action:** Reroll a hostile creature's last d20 roll against you and choose which result to use.
- **Rewrite a moment:** Revise your last narrative action (GM discretion).

##### Examples of Meaningful Complications

Here are examples of how different Hindrances could create a Meaningful Complication that earns a Fate Undo Token:

- **Code-Bound**: You refuse to take the most efficient or safe path because it violates your code (e.g., refusing to steal a necessary item, choosing not to attack a defenseless enemy even when tactically vital).
- **Old Injury**: Your injury causes you to fail a crucial physical task you would normally succeed at, directly hindering an important action (e.g., failing a jump necessary to escape, dropping a heavy but essential item mid-climb).
- **Notorious Reputation**: Being recognized by someone in power or a hostile faction directly prevents access, initiates unwanted conflict, or causes a crucial NPC to refuse aid.
- **Magical Resonance**: Your uncontrolled magical side effect directly disrupts a key action, reveals the party's presence when stealth was critical, or causes unintended harm/difficulty.

##### Hindrance Categories

**Personality Hindrances:**

- **Code-Bound**: You follow principles that sometimes limit your options
- **Impulsive**: You act before thinking when emotions run high
- **Stubbornly Independent**: You refuse help even when you need it

**Physical Hindrances:**

- **Old Injury**: A permanent wound sometimes flares up at the worst moments
- **Recognizable Mark**: A distinctive appearance makes you easy to identify and remember
- **Chronic Condition**: An illness or condition that requires management and occasionally worsens

**Social Hindrances:**

- **Notorious Reputation**: Your name or face is associated with events you may or may not be responsible for
- **Outsider**: Your origins or appearance mark you as different in most communities
- **Nemesis**: Someone powerful holds a grudge against you and actively works against you

**Supernatural Hindrances:**

- **Haunted**: Spirits, memories, or actual ghosts follow you
- **Marked by Power**: Your connection to magic is visible and potentially alarming to others
- **Cosmic Attention**: Something beyond mortal understanding has noticed you

##### Paying Hindrances Effectively

The best hindrances:

- **Connect to your character's backstory:** "My fear of fire stems from watching my village burn."
- **Create dramatic moments:** "I insist we help these refugees, even though it will delay our critical mission."
- **Evolve over time:** "I'm learning to control my anger, but certain triggers still send me over the edge."
- **Balance limitation with agency:** "I cannot lie due to my oath, but I can find creative ways to misdirect."

> **Player Tip:** Don't wait for the GM to invoke your hindrance! Proactively look for opportunities to demonstrate how it affects your character. Say "This is where my hindrance would come into play" if you think a situation warrants it.

##### Hindrance in Action

**GM:** "The noble offers you gold to retrieve an item from the haunted ruins. He seems nervous, not telling you everything."

**Player (with 'Code-Bound' hindrance):** "My character has a code that demands full honesty in agreements. I press him for the complete truth, even though it might cost us the job."

**GM:** "The noble hesitates, then admits the item belongs to a rival and this is essentially a theft. He offers more gold for your discretion."

**Player:** "I refuse the job outright and suggest we leave. This goes against my code of honor."

**GM:** "That's a meaningful complication from your hindrance—you're giving up a lucrative opportunity that would have advanced the plot. Here's a Fate Undo Token."

#### The Final Flourishes

Complete your character with these important finishing touches:

##### Name

What are you called? Does your name have meaning or history?

> Examples: Thorne, named for the thornbushes where he was found as an infant

##### Apearance

What immediately stands out about you? Any distinctive features?

> Examples: Runes tattooed on the back of his hands that glow when he uses his magic

##### Prsonality

Note key traits, ideals, and bonds.

> **Examples:** Quiet but observant, with occasional bursts of dry humor. Believes knowledge should be free to all

##### Anchor

What keeps you grounded when everything else fails?

> **Examples:**
>
> - **A memento:** "My father's broken sword reminds me why I fight."
> - **A promise:** "I swore to return to my village with the cure."
> - **A principle:** "Justice must prevail, even when mercy cannot."

##### Question

What unresolved mystery drives you forward?

> **Examples:**
>
> - **Personal:** "Who killed my mentor, and why?"
> - **Identity:** "Am I truly the last of my kind?"
> - **Purpose:** "What is my magic truly capable of?"

### 2.7 Game Mechanics

#### Hit Points (HP)

Starting HP = Maximum value of your Class Hit Die + your Constitution modifier

> **Examples:**
>
> - A Champion (d10) with +1 Constitution starts with 11 HP
> - A Scholar (d6) with +0 Constitution starts with 6 HP
> - An Adapter (d10) with +2 Constitution starts with 12 HP

#### Spell Points (SP)

At 1st level, you have **10 SP**. You can spend a maximum of **3 SP** on a single spell activation. You regain all SP after a Long Rest.

> **SP in Action:** *Thorne knows the Bolt spell. At 1st level, he can only use its Basic Effect (0 SP). At 2nd level, he might learn the Standard Bolt Mode (2 SP), allowing him to cast a bolt that deals 3d8 damage.*

#### Looking Ahead

As you gain levels, you'll learn **Enhancements** (2 per level from level 2 onwards) that let you spend SP to customize your spells in creative ways.

> **Example:** *At 3rd level, Thorne could enhance his Bolt spell with both the "Chain Bolt" (+2 SP) to create a powerful fire bolt that jumps from one enemy to another.*
> **Remember:** Characters evolve through play. You don't need perfect details to start having fun—the most memorable development often emerges organically from shared adventures!
