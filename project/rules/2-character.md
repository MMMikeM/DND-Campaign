## 2. Forging Your Character

Character creation isn't about filling out a form—it's about crafting someone you're excited to be. This section walks you through breathing life into a hero whose story you want to tell, following a path from core concept to the fine details.

### 2.1 The Spark: Your Concept

Before touching dice or numbers, envision who your character is at their core. What drives them? What makes them memorable? Consider:

- **What's their story?** A village healer who whispers to spirits? A former soldier with nothing else to live for? A street-smart hustler who learned magic by accident?
- **What's their approach to problems?** Bold confrontation? Clever misdirection? Careful observation? Inspiring leadership?

> **Quick Concept Builder**: Pick one trait from each: [determined/curious/cautious] + [protector/seeker/rebel/survivor] + [disciplined/instinctive/scholarly/charismatic]

### 2.2 Defining Capabilities: Ability Scores

Your character's natural talents are represented by six core abilities. 
These modifiers will affect nearly every roll you make. 
Assign each modifier from this set to one ability score:

**+3, +2, +1, +0, +0, -1**

- **Strength (Str)**: Physical power and athletic capability
- **Dexterity (Dex)**: Agility, reflexes, and coordination
- **Constitution (Con)**: Endurance, vitality, and resilience
- **Intelligence (Int)**: Reasoning, memory, and knowledge
- **Wisdom (Wis)**: Perception, intuition, and awareness
- **Charisma (Cha)**: Personal magnetism and force of will

**Guidance:**
Think about your Concept. Which ability best represents their primary strength? This ability will often align with the **Core Ability** of the Class you choose in Step 2.4. Assign your **+3** there. Distribute the remaining modifiers (+2, +2, +1, +1, +0) to reflect their other strengths and weaknesses based on your concept.

### 2.3 Roots: Forge Your Background

Your background is who you were *before* adventure called. It shaped your skills and connections. Instead of rigid categories, define your background by selecting:

1. **Two Skill Proficiencies:** Choose **two** skills from the standard list, to gain +3 to checks made with that skill. Choose skills that reflect your past experiences.
2. **A Story Hook:** Create a connection to the world that your GM can use to draw you into adventures. This is a narrative benefit, not a mechanical one. Examples:
  
    - "I have contacts in the thieves' guild who still owe me favors."
    - "The remote monastery where I trained still seeks my counsel."
    - "My family name opens doors in certain noble circles."
    - "I know secret routes through the wilderness few others have mapped."

Skill Proficiencies:

| Str        | Dex            | Con          | Int          | Wis             | Cha          |
| :--------- | :------------- | :----------- | :----------- | :-------------- | :----------- |
| Athletics  | Acrobatics     | *(None)*     | Arcana       | Animal Handling | Deception    |
|            | Sleight of Hand|              | History      | Insight         | Intimidation |
|            | Stealth        |              | Investigation| Medicine        | Performance  |
|            |                |              | Nature       | Perception      | Persuasion   |
|            |                |              | Religion     | Survival        |              |


### 2.4 Defining Your Path: Choose Your Class

Your Class defines *how* your character channels magical power and approaches challenges in the present. It provides your core archetype and mechanical framework.

1. **Review the Classes:** Read through the descriptions in **Section 7: Classes**. Pay attention to the **Unique Spell** and **Key Ability** score for each class – ideally, this should match the ability where you placed your +3 modifier in Step 2.2. Choose the Class that best fits your Character Concept.
2. **Note Your Class Benefits:** Your chosen class determines several key things:
    - One **Unique Spell**, that is unique to your chosen class.
    - What your **Key Attribute** is.
    - Your armor, weapon and saving throw **Proficiencies** are.
    - Your **Health Points** (used for Hit Points in Step 2.8).

### 2.5 Shaping Your Magic: Choose Essences

**Essences** define the *look, feel, and damage type* of your magic, bridging the gap between the mechanical Spell framework and your character's unique expression. Refer to **Section 4: Essences** for the full list and details.

- **Choose Two Essence Descriptors:** Select **two** Essences from the list in Section 4.5 (e.g., Fire, Shadow, Life, Psychic).
- **Reflect Your Concept & Class:** These choices should strongly tie into your Character Concept (Step 2.1) and Class (Step 2.4). How does *your* character's magic manifest?
  - A Champion drawing on righteous fury might choose **Light** and **Fire**.
  - A Trickster weaving illusions might choose **Shadow** and **Psychic**.
  - A Sage attuned to nature might choose **Life** and **Earth**.
- **Remember Their Use:** When you activate a Spell (Step 2.6), you'll choose *one* of your known Essences to apply, determining its damage type (if any) and providing the descriptive flavor. Enhancements (Step 2.9) may later allow you to add the Essence's associated status effect.


### 2.6 Mastering Effects: Selecting Spells

Your Class (Step 2.4) grants you access to **Spells** – the fundamental templates for your magical effects. At 1st level, you **know four Spells**. You do not need to prepare them daily.

Refer to your chosen Class description in **Section 2.3** and the general spell rules in **Section 3: Spells** to determine your starting spells:

1. **Core Attack Spell:** Your class grants you knowledge of `Strike`, `Bolt`, or lets you choose one. Note this spell.
2. **Unique Thematic Spell:** Your class grants you knowledge of a specific mandatory Spell central to its theme (e.g., `Barrier` for Champion, `Move` for Trickster). Note this spell.
3. **Choice Spells (Choose 2):** Your class provides a list of **Available Spells**. Choose **two** additional Spells from that list. Note these spells.

You now know your four starting Spells. Familiarize yourself with their **Basic Effects** (0 SP cost) listed in Section 3.4.

### 6.7 Adding Depth: Your Hindrance

Compelling heroes have flaws. Your hindrance is a significant weakness or complication that occasionally creates trouble—but also adds depth and roleplaying opportunities.

When your hindrance meaningfully complicates things during play, the GM might award **Fate Undo Tokens** (advantage on a crucial roll when you need it most).

Create your own hindrance or use these as inspiration:

- **Code-Bound**: You follow principles that sometimes limit your options.
- **Haunted**: Past trauma or literal ghosts follow you.
- **Impulsive**: You act before thinking when emotions run high.
- **Outspoken**: You speak truth even when silence would serve better.
- **Skeptical**: You distrust what others accept, sometimes to your detriment.
- **Stubbornly Independent**: You refuse help even when you need it.


### 6.8 Calculating Vitality: Hit Points (HP)

Your Hit Points determine how much punishment you can take before falling unconscious.

- **Starting HP at 1st Level:** `Maximum value of your Class Hit Die + your Constitution modifier` (from Step 6.2).
  - *Example:* A Champion (d10 Hit Die) with a +2 Constitution modifier starts with 10 + 2 = 12 HP.
- **HP Gain on Level Up:** When you gain a level after 1st, you gain additional HP. `Take the half your class hit die rounded up (d6=4, d8=5, d10=6, d12=7) + Con modifier`.

Record your starting HP.

### 6.9 The Final Flourishes

Fill in the remaining details that bring your character fully to life:

- **Name**: What are you called? Does your name have meaning?
- **Appearance**: What immediately stands out? Any distinctive features or style?
- **Personality:** Briefly note key traits, ideals, bonds, and how your Hindrance manifests.
- **Anchor**: What keeps you grounded? (A memento? A promise? A person?)
- **Question**: What mystery or unresolved question drives you forward?

Remember, characters evolve. You don't need to have everything perfect to start having fun; the most memorable character developments often emerge organically from shared adventures and improvisation! You're ready to begin!
