## 2. Forging Your Character

Character creation isn't about filling out a form—it's about crafting someone you're excited to be. This section walks you through breathing life into a hero whose story you want to tell, following a path from concept to completion.

### **2.1 The Spark: Your Concept**

Before touching dice or numbers, envision who your character is at their core. What drives them? What makes them memorable? Consider:

- **What's their story?** A village healer who whispers to spirits? A former soldier with nothing left to lose? A street-smart hustler who learned magic by accident?
- **What's their approach to problems?** Bold confrontation? Clever misdirection? Careful observation? Inspiring leadership?
- **What sets them apart?** Unusual talents? A distinctive appearance? A unique perspective shaped by their past?

> **Example Concept:** Thorne was once a respected temple guardian before his reckless pursuit of power led to the shrine's destruction. Now he channels earth essence through disciplined martial forms, seeking redemption by protecting others—even as the ghosts of his past haunt his dreams.

#### **Quick Concept Builder**

Pick one option from each table (or roll a d6 for each) to jumpstart your character concept:

| Background (d6)        | Motivation (d6) | Temperament (d6) | Approach (d6)             |
|:-----------------------|:----------------|:-----------------|:--------------------------|
| 1. Disgraced noble     | 1. Revenge      | 1. Calculated    | 1. Scholarly analysis     |
| 2. Former cultist      | 2. Redemption   | 2. Impulsive     | 2. Brute force            |
| 3. Wilderness survivor | 3. Discovery    | 3. Stoic         | 3. Social manipulation    |
| 4. Guild artisan       | 4. Protection   | 4. Curious       | 4. Intuitive instinct     |
| 5. Street criminal     | 5. Ambition     | 5. Passionate    | 5. Adaptive improvisation |
| 6. Accidental hero     | 6. Legacy       | 6. Cautious      | 6. Meticulous planning    |

### **2.2 Defining Capabilities: Ability Scores**

Your character's natural talents are represented by six core abilities. These modifiers affect nearly every roll you make. Assign these modifiers to your abilities:

**`+3, +2, +1, +0, +0, -1`**

- **Strength (Str)**: Physical power and athletic capability
- **Dexterity (Dex)**: Agility, reflexes, and coordination
- **Constitution (Con)**: Endurance, vitality, and resilience
- **Intelligence (Int)**: Reasoning, memory, and knowledge
- **Wisdom (Wis)**: Perception, intuition, and awareness
- **Charisma (Cha)**: Personal magnetism and force of will

> **Embracing Specialization**: Every hero has strengths and weaknesses—that's what makes them interesting! Your +3 represents what you excel at, while your -1 is an opportunity for memorable roleplaying and creative problem-solving. A brilliant scholar might struggle to lift heavy objects. A mighty champion might miss social cues. These contrasts create depth and encourage teamwork.

Think about your Concept. Which ability best represents their primary strength? This ability will often align with the **Key Ability** of the Class you choose in Step **2.5**. Assign your **+3** there, then distribute the remaining modifiers to reflect their other talents and limitations.

### **2.3 Core Mechanics: Proficiency Bonus**

This system uses a fixed **Proficiency Bonus (+3)** regardless of character level. This emphasizes consistent baseline capability rather than scaling numerical advantage, focusing progression on Feats, Spell Points, and Enhancements.

Characters can have proficiency in skills, saving throws, armor, and weapons:

- **Weapon proficiency**: Add your proficiency bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls with that weapon
- **Armor proficiency**: Don armor without penalty
  - *Non-proficient armor*: -10ft movement speed and disadvantage on physical ability checks
  - *Heavy armor*: Always imposes disadvantage on stealth checks, regardless of proficiency

### **2.4 Roots: Forge Your Background (Skills)**

Your past experiences have honed certain abilities. Choose **two skills** from the table below to gain proficiency.

When making a **Skill Check**, roll a d20 and add:

`Skill Check = 1d20 + Ability Modifier + Proficiency Bonus (if proficient)`

**Skill Proficiencies:**

| Str       | Dex             | Int           | Wis             | Cha          | Con      |
|:----------|:----------------|:--------------|:----------------|:-------------|:---------|
| Athletics | Acrobatics      | Arcana        | Animal Handling | Deception    | *(None)* |
|           | Sleight of Hand | History       | Insight         | Intimidation |          |
|           | Stealth         | Investigation | Medicine        | Performance  |          |
|           |                 | Nature        | Perception      | Persuasion   |          |
|           |                 | Religion      | Survival        |              |          |

### **2.5 Defining Your Path: Choose Your Class**

Your Class defines *how* your character channels magical power and approaches challenges. It provides your core archetype and mechanical framework.

1. **Review the Classes:** Select a class that fits your Character Concept
2. **Note Your Class Benefits:** Your chosen class determines:
   - Your **Key Ability** score (used for spellcasting)
   - Your **Unique Spell** (that only your class can access)
   - Your **Hit Die** (for calculating HP)
   - Your **Proficiencies** in armor, weapons, and saving throws

**Classes at a Glance:**

| Class     | Key Ability  | Unique Spell | Hit Die | Archetype                         |
|:----------|:-------------|:-------------|:--------|:----------------------------------|
| Champion  | Strength     | Barrier      | d10     | Protector, mighty warrior         |
| Trickster | Dexterity    | Move         | d8      | Swift, cunning combatant          |
| Adapter   | Constitution | Adapt Self   | d10     | Resilient, shapeshifting survivor |
| Scholar   | Intelligence | Manipulate   | d6      | Brilliant, calculated caster      |
| Sage      | Wisdom       | Arcane Sight | d8      | Perceptive, intuitive guide       |
| Orator    | Charisma     | Influence    | d8      | Compelling, force of personality  |

> **Class Selection Tip:** Ideally, your **Key Ability** should match where you placed your +3 modifier in Step 2.2. See **Section 3: Classes** for complete class details.

### **2.6 Core Mechanics: Saving Throws**

When a spell, trap, or other effect requires you to resist it, you make a **Saving Throw**:

`Saving Throw = 1d20 + Ability Modifier + Proficiency Bonus (if proficient)`

Your class grants proficiency in specific Saving Throws:

- **Champion:** Strength, Constitution
- **Trickster:** Dexterity, Intelligence
- **Adapter:** Constitution, Wisdom
- **Scholar:** Intelligence, Wisdom
- **Sage:** Wisdom, Charisma
- **Orator:** Charisma, Dexterity

### **2.7 Core Mechanics: Spellcasting**

Your **Key Ability** (determined by your class) drives your spellcasting. The modifier from this ability is your **Spellcasting Ability Modifier** (often shortened to **Spell Mod**):

- **Spell Attack Bonus = Your Spellcasting Ability Modifier**
- **Spell Save DC = 10 + Your Spellcasting Ability Modifier**

Many spell effects, particularly those dealing damage or healing, also scale based on your **Spell Mod**.

### **2.8 Shaping Your Magic: Choose Essences**

**Essences** define the *look, feel, and damage type* of your magic, bridging the gap between mechanical framework and your character's unique expression.

- **Choose Two Essence Descriptors:** Select **two** Essences from the list in Section 4.5 (e.g., Fire, Shadow, Life, Psychic)
- **Reflect Your Concept & Class:** These choices should strongly tie into your Character Concept and Class

**Essence Inspiration Examples:**

- A Champion who served as a lighthouse keeper might choose **Light** and **Force**, manifesting shields of blinding energy
- A Trickster raised among thieves might choose **Shadow** and **Sound**, creating diversions and illusions
- A Sage who survived in the wilderness might choose **Life** and **Earth**, channeling primal nature forces
- An Adapter with a mysterious bloodline might choose **Fire** and **Lightning**, their body crackling with inherited power
- A Scholar obsessed with cosmic mysteries might choose **Psychic** and **Cold**, drawing power from the void between stars
- An Orator with a musical background might choose **Sound** and **Light**, weaving performances into magic

When you activate a Spell, you'll choose *one* of your known Essences to apply, determining its damage type and descriptive flavor.

### **2.9 Mastering Effects: Selecting Spells**

Your Class grants you access to four **Base Spells** that you can use freely:

1. **Core Attack Spell:** Your class grants you knowledge of `Strike`, `Bolt`, or lets you choose between them
2. **Unique Spell:** Your class grants you a specific spell that only your class can access
3. **Choice Spells (Choose 2):** Choose **two** additional Spells from your class's list of **Available Spells**

> **Example:** Lyra the Champion automatically receives `Strike` (Core Attack) and `Barrier` (Unique Spell). From the Champion's Available Spells list, she chooses `Blast` and `Defend` to round out her four starting spells.

Record your four starting Spells and familiarize yourself with their **Basic Effects** (0 SP cost) listed in Section 5.4. These 0 SP effects are always available to you, forming your baseline magical abilities.

### **2.10 Adding Depth: Your Hindrance**

Compelling heroes have flaws. Your hindrance is a significant weakness or complication that occasionally creates trouble—but also adds depth and roleplaying opportunities.

When your hindrance meaningfully complicates things during play, the GM may award a **Fate Undo Token**, which allows you to:

- Undo your last roll
- Undo a roll against you
- Undo your last narrative action

Choose from these hindrance categories or create your own:

**Personality Hindrances:**

- **Code-Bound**: You follow principles that sometimes limit your options
- **Impulsive**: You act before thinking when emotions run high
- **Skeptical**: You distrust what others accept, sometimes to your detriment
- **Stubbornly Independent**: You refuse help even when you need it

**Physical Hindrances:**

- **Old Injury**: A permanent wound sometimes flares up at the worst moments
- **Sensory Limitation**: Partial deafness, colorblindness, or other sensory impairment
- **Recognizable Mark**: A distinctive appearance makes you easy to identify and remember
- **Chronic Condition**: An illness or condition that requires management and occasionally worsens

**Social Hindrances:**

- **Notorious Reputation**: Your name or face is associated with events you may or may not be responsible for
- **Outsider**: Your origins or appearance mark you as different in most communities
- **Obligation**: A debt, duty, or commitment that pulls you away at inconvenient times
- **Nemesis**: Someone powerful holds a grudge against you and actively works against you

**Supernatural Hindrances:**

- **Haunted**: Spirits, memories, or actual ghosts follow you
- **Magical Resonance**: Your presence triggers unpredictable minor magical effects
- **Marked by Power**: Your connection to magic is visible and potentially alarming to others
- **Cosmic Attention**: Something beyond mortal understanding has noticed you

### **2.11 Calculating Vitality: Hit Points (HP)**

Your Hit Points determine how much punishment you can take before falling unconscious.

- **Starting HP at 1st Level:** `Maximum value of your Class Hit Die + your Constitution modifier`
  - *Example:* A Champion (d10 Hit Die) with a +1 Constitution modifier starts with 10 + 1 = 11 HP
  - *Example:* A Scholar (d6 Hit Die) with a +0 Constitution modifier starts with 6 + 0 = 6 HP

- **HP Gain on Level Up:** When you gain a level after 1st, you gain additional HP equal to:
  - `Half your class hit die rounded up (d6=3, d8=4, d10=5, d12=6) + your Constitution modifier`

### **2.12 Future Growth: Understanding Enhancements & Spell Points**

As you gain experience, you'll unlock more powerful and versatile magical abilities:

- **Spell Points (SP):** Your magical energy pool. At 1st level, you have 10 SP, scaling with your level (see Section 6.4). You regain all SP after a Long Rest.
- **Enhancements:** As you gain levels, you'll learn Enhancements (2 per level from level 2 onwards) that let you spend SP to augment your spells in creative ways.
- **Maximum SP per Activation:** At 1st level, you can spend a maximum of 3 SP on a single spell activation. This limit increases as you gain levels (see Section 6.4).

> **Example:** Neville has the `Bolt` spell. At 1st level, he can only use its Basic Effect (0 SP). At 2nd level, he could learn the Standard Bolt Mode (2 SP) and the Accurate Bolt Enhancement (+1 SP). When he casts the spell, he could spend 3 SP total (his maximum) to fire an accurate standard bolt dealing 3d8 damage.

### **2.13 The Final Flourishes**

Fill in the remaining details that bring your character fully to life:

- **Name**: What are you called? Does your name have meaning or history?
- **Appearance**: What immediately stands out? Any distinctive features or style?
- **Personality:** Briefly note key traits, ideals, and bonds.

**Anchors & Questions:**
Two special elements add depth and drive to your character:

- **Anchor**: What keeps you grounded when everything else fails?
  - *A memento:* "My father's broken sword reminds me why I fight."
  - *A promise:* "I swore to return to my village with the cure."
  - *A person:* "My sister depends on me; I can't fail her."
  - *A principle:* "Justice must prevail, even when mercy cannot."

- **Question**: What unresolved mystery drives you forward?
  - *Personal:* "Who killed my mentor, and why?"
  - *Cosmic:* "What lies beyond the veil between worlds?"
  - *Identity:* "Am I truly the last of my kind?"
  - *Purpose:* "What is my magic truly capable of?"

> **Remember:** Characters evolve. You don't need to have everything perfect to start having fun; the most memorable character developments often emerge organically from shared adventures and improvisation! You're ready to begin!
