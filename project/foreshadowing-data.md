## 3. Major Conflicts

| ID | Name | Scope | Nature | Status | Core Dilemma |
|----|------|-------|--------|--------|--------------|
| 2 | The Miasma Front | regional | military | escalating | Whether to focus resources on holding territory or evacuating civilians, and how much individual freedom can be sacrificed for collective defense |
| 3 | The Vessels Gathering | regional | mystical | brewing | Whether divine vessels should be protected as individuals with rights or utilized as weapons for the greater good |
| 4 | Artifacts of Power | regional | mystical | active | Whether artifacts should be used solely as weapons or preserved as sacred relics, and who deserves to wield such power |
| 5 | The Refugee Crisis | regional | social | escalating | How to balance compassion for refugees with security concerns, and whether to prioritize those with special abilities or treat all equally |
| 6 | The Shadow War | local | social | active | Whether harsh Oath-Marked control or exploitative Salt Knives influence is truly better for civilians, and if the ends justify the means for either faction |

### Detailed Conflict Descriptions

#### ID 2: The Miasma Front
**Cause:** The Saflar invasion pushing south toward Paphos with ever-increasing Miasma corruption

**Description:**
- The Saflar forces are advancing south along multiple fronts, transforming land and people
- The Oath-Marked and remaining Sentinels are establishing defensive lines that are increasingly difficult to hold
- Civilians flee south creating a refugee crisis in Paphos and coastal cities
- The front shifts almost daily as Miasma tears appear unpredictably behind defensive lines
- Small resistance cells operate behind enemy lines to slow the Saflar advance

**Stakes:**
- The survival of Cyprus as a culturally distinct entity
- The protection of sacred sites and divine artifacts
- The fate of thousands of refugees who cannot flee further south
- Control of strategic locations with natural resistance to the Miasma
- Preservation of knowledge and techniques to fight the corruption

**Possible Outcomes:**
- A fortified defensive line established using divine artifacts at key locations
- Guerrilla resistance continuing in northern territories while protecting the south
- Reclamation of certain territories through coordinated divine vessel actions
- Stalemate with the front stabilizing along natural barriers
- Gradual retreat to Paphos for a final stand at Aphrodite's sanctuary

**Hidden Truths:**
- The Miasma specifically targets areas with dormant divine connections
- Some Saflar forces include Cypriots who were transformed but retain fragments of their identities
- The Miasma behaves differently near ancient temple sites, sometimes revealing exploitable weaknesses
- Certain divine bloodlines working together can temporarily seal smaller tears
- The Miasma's advance accelerates when divine vessels are in conflict with each other

#### ID 3: The Vessels Gathering
**Cause:** Ancient prophecy of "The Eleven Flames" speaking of divine vessels that must unite their powers to seal the greatest tears

**Description:**
- Divine bloodlines across Cyprus are manifesting powers at an unprecedented rate
- The House of Vessels and various temples compete to identify and secure potential vessels
- Lyra's connection to Hestia becomes increasingly evident as her powers develop
- Other factions attempt to use vessels for their own purposes rather than following the prophecy
- Signs and omens associated with all eleven gods appear throughout Paphos

**Stakes:**
- The potential to permanently seal major Miasma tears
- Control over individuals with divine powers
- Interpretation of the prophecy and divine will
- Balance of power between various religious and military factions
- The autonomy and safety of the vessels themselves

**Possible Outcomes:**
- All eleven vessels united in a coordinated ritual to push back the Miasma
- Individual vessels choosing different factions causing further division
- Some vessels rejecting their divine connection entirely
- Partial success with some gods' vessels working together while others refuse
- Discovery that the prophecy has been misinterpreted and requires a different approach

**Hidden Truths:**
- The eleventh vessel (Hestia's) is key to binding the others together
- The Saflar are actively hunting divine vessels for elimination or corruption
- The vessels' powers grow stronger when they follow their deity's nature rather than being forced
- Previous attempts at similar rituals have failed catastrophically
- The gods themselves are not in complete agreement about how their powers should be used
