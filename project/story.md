# Cyprus Campaign Setting: The Divine Vessels

## Core Conflict

Cyprus is under assault by an invading force called **The Saflar** from the north, who bring with them a mysterious corrupting force known as **The Miasma**. This corruption transforms both land and people, advancing steadily southward. The last major defensive position is around the city of **Paphos** in the south, where divine protection is strongest.

At the heart of the conflict is an ancient prophecy about **"The Eleven Flames"** - individuals with divine bloodlines who must unite their powers to seal tears in reality that allow the Miasma to enter the world.

## Divine Elements

The setting centers around **Greek gods** who have ties to Cyprus, with **Aphrodite** having the strongest connection (Cyprus being her mythological birthplace). Each god has vessels - mortals with divine bloodlines who can manifest powers related to their patron deity.

Key aspects of the divine framework:

- **Divine Vessels**: Mortals with godly bloodlines who can manifest divine powers
- **Divine Artifacts**: Ancient items created by the gods that have special powers, especially when wielded by their corresponding vessel
- **The Miasma**: A corrupting force that seems to specifically target divine domains and boundaries

## Campaign Style

The campaign embraces moral complexity in a Witcher-inspired style, with:

- Personal stakes driving larger political conflicts
- Morally gray choices with no perfect solutions
- Actions having unexpected consequences that ripple outward
- Varied opposition ranging from sympathetic to truly malevolent
- Local stories revealing global stakes

This framework provides a rich setting for a campaign that focuses on personal stories against the backdrop of cosmic conflict, with divine heritage serving as both blessing and burden for those caught in the struggle.
