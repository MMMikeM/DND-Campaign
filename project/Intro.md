"The endless blue of the Great Sea finally gives way. After weeks aboard ship, the rugged coast of Cyprus rises from the haze. Your reasons for undertaking this voyage are your own – escaping troubles, chasing rumors, seeking answers, or perhaps guided by a faint prayer to one of the old gods.

Paphos lies before you, the ancient city spilling down hillsides toward a crescent harbor. White stone gleams in the sun, with the magnificent Temple of Aphrodite crowning the skyline. Yet even from the deck, you see signs of a world under strain – watchtowers dotting the cliffs, refugee ships crowding the harbor, and an unnatural haze clinging to the distant northern hills.

Throughout your journey, you've heard whispers of the Saflar invasion from the north and the strange Miasma that follows in their wake – a corruption that twists land, beasts, and people alike. They say Paphos holds the line, protected by Aphrodite and the other gods whose shrines dot the island, but looking at the weary faces on the approaching docks, you wonder how long such protection can last.

As your ship finally docks, the sounds and smells of Paphos wash over you: gulls and hawkers, salt and woodsmoke, an undercurrent of fear beneath the bustle of commerce. The harbor teems with distinct groups:

Armored soldiers patrol in disciplined units, many bearing ritualistic scar patterns on their forearms – the Oath-Marked, you've heard them called. Others stand watch with intense, unblinking vigilance, scanning arrivals not just for weapons but for subtler signs – the Sleepless Sentinels, the first line of defense against corruption.

Swift couriers dart through crowds, exchanging packages or whispered words before vanishing again. Dockhands keep their heads down, muttering darkly about the 'Salt Knives' who seem to control the flow of goods and passage in these lower quarters. Near the warehouses, small groups huddle over faded maps and strange artifacts – treasure hunters or scholars, perhaps, trading in secrets and salvaged history.

From the temple district uphill comes the layered sound of multiple traditions chanting, a desperate chorus seeking divine intervention, even as organized groups tend to refugees with quiet determination.

You stand as outsiders on a troubled shore, while rumors persist of hidden artifacts, individuals manifesting divine gifts, and prophecies of 'The Flames of the Gods' – perhaps the island's last hope. Cyprus is wounded, but the embers of defiance still glow.

The journey here is over; the true challenge begins. What calling brought you to this precipice? Which god's echo guides your hand? What purpose will you carve in this city living on borrowed time?"
