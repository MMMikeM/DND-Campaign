# Cyprus Campaign Pantheon: The Divine Protectors

## Core Framework
The Cyprus campaign centers on **Greek gods** with ties to the island, with **Aphrodite** having the strongest connection (Cyprus being her mythological birthplace). Divine power manifests through:

- **Divine Vessels**: Mortals with godly bloodlines who can manifest divine powers
- **Divine Artifacts**: Ancient items created by the gods that have special powers when wielded by their corresponding vessel
- **The Miasma**: A corrupting force that targets divine domains and boundaries

## Hidden Knowledge (GM Only)
The pantheon actually consists of **eleven** gods, not ten. The forgotten deity, Hestia (goddess of the hearth, home, and family), will be gradually revealed through the campaign as players encounter:

- Ancient shrines with an empty alcove meant for an eleventh deity
- Folk traditions centered around hearth fires that provide unusual protection
- Communities with hearth-centered rituals showing resistance to the Miasma
- References in fragmentary texts to "the binding flame" or "central hearth"

Hestia's vessel (Lyra Stavros) appears to be merely resilient to the Miasma when first encountered. Only as the campaign progresses will her true nature as the vessel of the forgotten goddess become clear. Her power to purify corruption through the sanctity of hearth and home will prove essential to saving Cyprus.

## Hestia (Revealed Later)
- **Domains**: Hearth, home, family, sacred fire, domestic peace
- **Campaign Role**: The forgotten deity whose power binds the others together; essential for permanent Miasma purification
- **Artifact**: Hestia's Ember (thought to be merely a lucky charm when first found)
- **Anti-Corruption Power**: Creation of permanent sanctuaries; ability to purify corrupted areas through establishing "home"; power that amplifies other divine vessels when they work together
