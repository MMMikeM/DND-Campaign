**Sanderson Lecture 2 Cheatsheet: Plot - Promise, Progress, Payoff**

This cheatsheet covers the fundamental principles of plot construction as discussed in Brandon Sanderson's 2025 Lecture 2.

**I. The Purpose & Nature of Plot**

1. **Core Functions:**
    * **Facilitate Conflict:** The primary way to create struggles for characters (a thing needs doing, something stands in the way). Plot, Setting, and Character intersect to create Conflict.
    * **Provide Structure:** Gives the reader a sense of movement, direction, and understanding that a story is being told.

2. **Plot Scales:**
    * **Big P Plot (Capital P):** The overall story concept. What the book is *about* in a sentence or two (e.g., "Destroy the One Ring").
    * **Little p plot (Lowercase p):** Chapter-by-chapter engagement. The smaller problems, obstacles, and resolutions that keep the reader turning pages (e.g., "How do we get past these orcs?").

3. **Innovation & Structure:**
    * Plot is the *hardest* of the core three (Plot, Setting, Character) to innovate on successfully. Readers have ingrained expectations for satisfying story structures.
    * Don't fixate on creating a wholly unique plot structure. Combining familiar structures with unique characters and settings creates freshness (e.g., *Dune* / *Lion King* / *Hamlet* share a core structure but feel distinct).
    * Focus on being a "Chef": Understand *why* plot structures work and use them intentionally.

**II. Promise: Setting Expectations**

1. **What it is:** The setup at the beginning of your story (or section) that tells the reader what kind of experience they are in for and what questions will be answered or goals achieved.
2. **Importance:** Crucial for hooking readers and setting the stage. First few pages/chapter are vital.
3. **When to Perfect:** Often best revised *after* the first draft is complete. It's easier to promise accurately once you know the actual progress and payoff. Don't get stuck perfecting promises upfront (especially discovery writers).
4. **Types of Promises:**
    * **Tone Promise:** Establishes the *feel* of the story (humor, grimdark, epic, whimsical).
        * Achieved through: Prose style, early jokes/tragedy, character/place names (Stark vs. Hogwarts), prologues (common in epic fantasy to show action/stakes before a slower character start). *Warning:* Overused prologues can be clich√©.
    * **Structural Promise (Series):** Hints at the scope and continuation.
        * Achieved through: Introducing a group needing resolution (e.g., family needing spouses), explicit labeling (Book 1 of X), overarching stated goal (Wheel of Time), episodic framing (Dresden Files).
    * **Plot Promise (Microcosm/Cold Open):** A mini-story at the start that reflects the larger story's themes, conflicts, or character dynamics. (e.g., *Indiana Jones* opening).
    * **Conflict/Character Promise:** Introduces the central conflict (even metaphorically) or what the character wants/needs and their initial obstacles.
5. **Making New Promises:** Yes, stories (especially longer ones) introduce new promises as they progress (e.g., new character arcs, new subplots). Chapters often have mini-promises.

**III. Progress: The Sense of Movement**

1. **Author Control:** You have *absolute* control over pacing and time. You can spend 50 pages on one second or skip a thousand years.
2. **Goal:** Create a *satisfying sense* of progression towards the promised payoff.
3. **Key Elements:**
    * **Pacing:** How fast the story moves. Varies by genre (thriller vs. character study) and should ideally vary *within* a story (breathers are important). Relentless fast pacing can fatigue the reader, especially in longer works.
    * **Types of Progress & Signposting:** Readers need *visible indicators* that the story is moving forward *towards the promise*.
        * **Information Plot (Mysteries):** Progress = clues discovered, theories tested, suspects eliminated. Signpost via detective's reflections, revealing clues.
        * **Relationship Plot (Romance/Buddy Cop):** Progress = characters overcoming conflict, finding common ground, helping each other. Signpost via interactions, shared moments, changing attitudes.
        * **Adventure/Goal Plot:** Progress = overcoming obstacles, reaching milestones, acquiring tools/allies needed for the goal. Signpost via map-checking, reaching locations, defeating guardians.
    * **Identifying the *Real* Plot:** The surface plot (e.g., get the McGuffin) might be secondary to the thematic/character plot (e.g., become a team). Ensure progress happens on the plot that *matters most* for the payoff. (*Guardians of the Galaxy* example).
4. **Problem: Misaligned Promise & Progress:**
    * **Symptom:** Sections feel boring, readers disengage, subplots feel like detours.
    * **Cause:** The *progress* being shown doesn't connect to the *promises* the reader is invested in.
    * **Sanderson's Oathbringer Example:** Characters promised Destination B, got diverted to C. Readers felt it was a side quest with no progress towards B.
    * **Fix:** Make the *actual* progress (going to C) tie into a compelling *new promise* or reveal its necessity for the original promise (e.g., going to C is vital to save someone).
5. **Skipping Time:** Perfectly acceptable. Use chapter/part breaks or clear indicators ("Three weeks later"). Establish the possibility early.

**IV. Payoff: Fulfilling the Promises**

1. **Goal:** Provide a *surprising yet inevitable* resolution to the promises made.
2. **Achieving "Surprising Yet Inevitable":**
    * **Obstacles & Escalations:** Make the path to the payoff difficult. Raise the stakes. Make the reader doubt success is possible. (*Lord of the Rings* examples: Shelob, Sam carrying Frodo).
    * **Plausible Deniability / Forgetting:** Make the journey so intense or complex that the reader (and characters) temporarily forget an earlier promise, making its fulfillment more impactful. (*Two Towers* film Helm's Deep ending vs. *RotK* film Minas Tirith ending).
    * **Twists:** Change the nature of the payoff.
        * *Not Required:* Satisfying payoffs without twists are common (*Pride & Prejudice*).
        * *Over-Deliver:* Promise a toy car, give a real car.
        * *Change the Desire:* Promise A, make the reader *want* B during the story, deliver B. Requires building investment in B. (*While You Were Sleeping* example).
        * *Subversion:* Promise A, deconstruct A, deliver something else entirely. Risky, needs careful setup to make the audience *want* the subversion (*Into the Woods* example).
3. **Impact:** When Promise, Progress, and Payoff align effectively, it creates emotional resonance (chills, cheers, tears) and reader satisfaction.

**V. Application for Different Writers**

1. **Outliners:** Can use these concepts to structure their outlines, ensuring logical flow and planned payoffs. Still involves discovery writing within the outline points.
2. **Discovery Writers:** Can use these concepts as *diagnostic tools* during revision. If a draft feels flat or readers are confused, analyze the Promises made vs. the Progress shown vs. the intended Payoff. Often, the fix involves adjusting the *Promises* (rewriting the beginning) to match the *Progress* that emerged during discovery writing.

This lecture provides the engine for your plot. Think of Promise as the ignition key and destination programming, Progress as the journey itself (requiring fuel, steering, and milestones), and Payoff as reaching the destination in a satisfying (and maybe unexpected) way.
