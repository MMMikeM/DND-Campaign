**Sanderson Lecture 3 Cheatsheet: Plot Frameworks & Models**

This cheatsheet surveys various plot structures discussed in Brandon Sanderson's 2025 Lecture 3, offering tools to experiment with. Remember the core principle: Be a Chef, not a Cook â€“ use these as flexible tools, not rigid formulas.

**I. Foundational Reminders**

1. **Plot Provides Conflict & Progress:**
    * A story isn't just a sequence of events ("The king died"). It's about the struggle and emotional journey ("The king died and then the queen died of grief" - better, but still needs character arc).
    * Progress can be forward or backward (like character backsliding in *Breaking Bad*), as long as the *story* moves towards its goal.

2. **Purposeful Obstacles:** Turn events into meaningful plot points. Obstacles should:
    * **Force Growth:** Push characters or the plot forward, often by removing support (Obi-Wan/Gandalf dying forces protagonists to step up).
    * **Reinforce Learning:** Test or confirm a character's recent breakthrough or the relevance of a discovered clue.
    * **Show Failure:** Highlight a character's flaw, lack of skill, or the villain's competence, proving the problem is difficult and justifying future growth/attempts.

**II. Plot Models & Frameworks (A Survey)**

* **General Caution:** Any framework treated as sacrosanct ("checklist thinking") can harm your story if it doesn't fit naturally. Be willing to adapt or discard parts. Use them to *help* you write, not constrain you unnecessarily.

1. **The Hero's Journey / Monomyth (via Dan Harmon's Story Circle):**
    * **Concept:** Circular journey. Character starts in a zone of comfort/ignorance -> Called to adventure (often resisted) -> Crosses a threshold (point of no return) -> Faces trials & learns -> Confronts divinity/inner darkness/father figure -> Pays a price to gain knowledge/skill ("elixir") -> Returns transformed, mastering both worlds & improving their origin point. It's often about the child becoming the adult.
    * **Pros:** Strong framework for character growth, satisfying payoff through visible change, taps into archetypal story patterns.
    * **Cons:** Can be vague; can be applied too rigidly (Sanderson's *Phantom Menace* "virgin birth" example); Campbell's original work has academic criticisms (sources, overreaching, gender bias).
    * **Use Cases:** Good for coming-of-age, transformation arcs, stories with clear mentorship. Can be layered or used for tragic arcs (refusing a step leads to downfall - *Name of the Wind* speculation).

2. **Yes, But / No, And:**
    * **Concept:** Focuses on *escalation*. Pose a problem/goal -> Does the character achieve it?
        * **Yes, but...** (Success + New Complication)
        * **No, and...** (Failure + New Complication)
    * Drives the story forward by constantly raising stakes or making the situation worse/more complex/more ridiculous.
    * **Pros:** Creates strong forward momentum, tension, and a feeling of spiraling stakes. Excellent for discovery writers letting events cascade. Good for thrillers, comedies, or specific sequences.
    * **Cons:** Can be exhausting in very long novels if not varied. Relies on constant escalation which can feel unsustainable.
    * **Use Cases:** Thrillers, action sequences, screwball comedies, plotting sections between major beats.

3. **Try/Fail Cycles & Points on the Map (Robert Jordan's Method):**
    * **Concept (Points on the Map):** Identify major plot points/events/destinations in advance (like landmarks on a road trip). Discovery-write the journey *between* these points.
    * **Concept (Try/Fail):** Before a character succeeds at a major task, they should *try* intelligent methods and *fail* at least once (often more). Failure should stem from flaws, lack of skill, or being outsmarted, *not* stupidity.
    * **Pros:** Balances structure and discovery. Allows foreshadowing key moments. Try/Fail builds stakes, demonstrates difficulty, justifies character growth, and addresses potential "plot holes" by showing simpler solutions don't work.
    * **Cons:** Requires knowing *some* key endpoints. Can still lead to very long books if the "between points" gets expansive (Wheel of Time example).
    * **Use Cases:** Hybrid outliner/discovery writers. Epic fantasy. Situations where demonstrating the difficulty of a task is important.

4. **Three-Act Structure (Hollywood Model):**
    * **Concept:** Linear structure, like an "arrow pointed at an explosion." Focuses on building conflict towards a climax. (Often feels like 4 acts due to the Midpoint's importance).
        * **Act I (Setup):** Introduce character, status quo, need. Establish the **Major Dramatic Question** (MDQ - *the* key question the story answers). Inciting Incident starts the cascade. Ends with **Plot Point 1** (Point of No Return). (~25% of story)
        * **Act II (Confrontation):** "Throwing rocks." Rising action, obstacles worsen, attempts fail.
            * **Midpoint:** Major turning point. Twist, escalation, reframing, makes it personal. Story shifts significantly. (~50% mark)
            * Continued rising action, stakes increase, leads to the **All is Lost** / Low Point before Act III. (~75% mark)
        * **Act III (Resolution):** Final push. Last chance based on something learned/gained. Climax answers the MDQ (success or failure). Followed by denouement/wrap-up. (~25% of story)
    * **Pros:** Familiar to Western audiences, provides clear structural beats, effective at building to a climax.
    * **Cons:** Can feel formulaic if followed too rigidly (*Save the Cat* critique). Might not fit all story types.
    * **Use Cases:** Mainstream commercial fiction, action/adventure, stories needing a strong, escalating structure. Useful for diagnosing pacing issues.

5. **Structure Model (Analyzing & Adapting Existing Structures):**
    * **Concept:** Choose a specific *sub-genre* or story type you admire (underdog sports story, locked-room mystery, specific heist). Analyze multiple examples to identify common beats, *why* they work, and recurring elements. Distill this into a flexible structure. Adapt that structure to *your* unique story, characters, and genre.
    * **Pros:** Excellent "Chef" practice. Leverages proven, effective structures. Can provide a solid foundation if you struggle with plotting. Adapting across genres creates novelty.
    * **Cons:** Requires research and analytical effort. Risk of imitation if not adapted sufficiently.
    * **Use Cases:** Situations where you admire a particular story *type* and want to understand its engine. When needing a strong structural base. Sanderson's *Way of Kings* Bridge Crew example (underdog sports story -> epic fantasy).

**III. Cross-Cutting Advice**

1. **Tropes:**
    * Don't obsessively avoid them; focus on *execution* and *your voice*.
    * Early work often relies heavily on tropes; mastery involves *consciously using* influences.
    * Reader expectations for tropes vary wildly by genre (e.g., some romance readers *want* listed tropes).
2. **Plot Holes:**
    * Distinguish real issues (things that pull readers out of the story) from nitpicks.
    * Address major issues flagged by beta readers, perhaps by "hanging a lantern" on them (acknowledging the oddity briefly).
    * Accept that perfect realism is impossible; focus on maintaining immersion for *your* story.
3. **The Learning Curve:**
    * New writers can't juggle everything. Focus on fundamentals first (writing consistently, finishing).
    * As basics become instinct, consciously add focus on structure, theme, etc.
    * Use these frameworks as diagnostic tools or for outlining *when you're ready*, don't let them paralyze you early on.

This lecture provides a menu of plotting approaches. Experiment to find what resonates with your style and specific project needs.
