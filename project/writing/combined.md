**Sanderson Lecture 1 Cheatsheet: Foundations & Philosophy**

This cheatsheet covers the introductory concepts and philosophical underpinnings discussed in Brandon Sanderson's 2025 Lecture 1.

**I. Core Philosophy & Approach**

1. **Be a Chef, Not a Cook:**
    * **Cook:** Follows recipes blindly. Can make *a* dish, but doesn't understand *why* it works or how to fix it if it fails.
    * **Chef:** Understands the *principles* behind the ingredients and techniques. Can adapt, create, diagnose problems, and innovate.
    * **Goal:** Learn the tools and *why* they work, so you can apply them effectively, adapt them, or even discard them consciously for *your* specific story and goals.

2. **Writing Advice is Subjective:**
    * What works for one writer (or even one project) might not work for another.
    * Expect to receive advice (even from Sanderson) that is *bad for you* specifically, or bad for you *right now*.
    * Your job is to experiment, learn what helps *you*, and build your own process.

3. **The Value of Writing (Professional vs. Hobbyist):**
    * Writing is intrinsically valuable for the artist ("making the artist's life more enriched"). Don't let external pressure ("Are you published?") diminish this.
    * It's okay (and wonderful) to be a non-professional writer.
    * **Class Assumption:** For the purpose of the lectures, assume the goal is to become a full-time professional SF/F novelist within ~10 years. This broad goal encompasses advice applicable to all writers.

4. **Artist vs. Mercenary Mindset:**
    * **During Writing:** The *Artist* is in charge. Make decisions based on what's best for the story and characters, maintaining artistic integrity.
    * **After Finishing:** The *Mercenary* takes over. Figure out the smartest, most effective (legal) ways to get the book to an audience and potentially earn from it, *without compromising the original artistic integrity*. The business side supports the art side.

**II. Writer Archetypes: Finding Your Process**

1. **Architect (Outliner):**
    * Builds a detailed structure/plan (like blueprints) before writing.
    * Knows where the story is going.
    * *Potential Pitfall:* Can feel the story is "already told," losing enthusiasm for the drafting. May skip revision because the *next* outlined book is more exciting. (Sanderson leans this way).

2. **Gardener (Discovery Writer / "Pantser"):**
    * Nurtures the story as it grows, discovering it along the way.
    * Relies on intuition and exploration during drafting.
    * *Potential Pitfall:* Can revise early chapters endlessly without finishing. Can get lost or write into corners. Can be easily swayed/derailed by early feedback. (Stephen King leans this way).

3. **The Reality:** Most writers are a *mix* ("Frankenstein monster"). You need to experiment to find where you fall on the spectrum and what each *project* requires. Your process will likely evolve over your career.

**III. Early Career Strategy: The First Books**

1. **Goal:** Learn Your Process & Build Skill. Your primary job isn't to sell your first books; it's to *learn* by writing them.
    * "The product of your writing time is you. You are the piece of art."

2. **Finish Multiple Books:** Expect to write several novels before you're publishable or hit your stride. (Sanderson mentions 3-5, sold his 6th; Dan Wells sold his 6th; Rachel sold her 7th).
    * Don't get stuck on Book 1 perfection.

3. **Embrace the "Ugly Baby":** Your early work likely won't match the vision in your head. Your skill needs time to catch up to your taste/aspirations. *Push through and finish anyway.* This is normal.

4. **Revise Your Early Books:** Revision is a separate, critical skill. Don't skip it, even on early work you don't plan to publish. Practice revision just like you practice drafting.
    * *Outliner Trap:* Thinking the next book will be better, so skipping revision.
    * *Discovery Writer Trap:* Revising endlessly without finishing a draft.

5. **Ideas are Cheap, Execution is Key:** Don't be afraid to "waste" ideas on practice novels. Great execution can make almost *any* idea work (Jim Butcher example: Pokémon + Lost Roman Legion = Codex Alera). Skilled writing is instantly recognizable.

6. **Same World Gambit:** It's fine to write multiple early books in the same world to leverage worldbuilding.
    * *Safer:* Standalone stories in the same setting.
    * *Riskier (but potential high reward):* Writing sequels before Book 1 sells (like Naomi Novik's Temeraire). If Book 1 doesn't sell, the sequels are harder to place. If it *does* sell big, having sequels ready is a huge advantage.

**IV. Motivation & Overcoming Challenges**

1. **Find Your Drive:** Understand what motivates *you*.
    * Intrinsic enjoyment (losing track of time).
    * External tracking (Sanderson's word count spreadsheet).
    * Habit bundling (linking writing/revision to existing habits).
    * Carrots vs. Sticks.
    * Binge vs. Consistent Small Bites.

2. **Dealing with Doubt/The Long Haul:**
    * Acknowledge the difficulty of "going pro" (maybe 1 in 20 from a dedicated group). Have realistic expectations but don't be paralyzed.
    * Make the internal decision: Are you a writer regardless of external success? (Sanderson's "belly of the whale" moment).
    * Survivorship Bias: Be aware that successful people's advice isn't a guaranteed path. Focus on gathering *tools*, not just following one person's story.

3. **Making Yourself Revise:**
    * Treat it as a skill to learn.
    * Make a plan/outline for the revision (like a bug list in programming). Target specific problems.
    * Get feedback (see Writing Groups) to inform the revision plan.
    * Use habit-building techniques (bundling, scheduling).

**V. Writing Groups & Feedback**

1. **Purpose:** A tool to get test audience reactions and practice processing feedback. Not for everyone, can be detrimental if misused.

2. **Key Rules for Success:**
    * **Discovery Writers:** Be very cautious about sharing work *before* a draft is finished. Early feedback can derail your discovery process.
    * **Receiving Feedback:**
        * Be a "fly on the wall." *Listen* and *take notes*.
        * Resist the urge to defend, explain, or argue. This skews the feedback.
        * Process the feedback *later*, when you're emotionally detached and in a revision mindset.
        * Expect to use only a portion (Sanderson uses ~1/3). Look for patterns.
    * **Giving Feedback:**
        * Be **Descriptive, Not Prescriptive.**
        * Describe *your experience* as a reader ("I felt confused here," "This character felt flat to me," "I was excited at this part").
        * Do *not* try to rewrite or "fix" the author's book ("You should add X," "Change the ending to Y"). Your job is to report your reaction, not be the editor.

This structure provides a solid starting point based *only* on Lecture 1. As you process subsequent lectures, you can add new sections (e.g., Plotting Tools, Character Arcs, Worldbuilding Techniques, Business Nuts & Bolts) and flesh out these foundational concepts with more specific tools and examples Sanderson provides.


**Sanderson Lecture 2 Cheatsheet: Plot - Promise, Progress, Payoff**

This cheatsheet covers the fundamental principles of plot construction as discussed in Brandon Sanderson's 2025 Lecture 2.

**I. The Purpose & Nature of Plot**

1. **Core Functions:**
    * **Facilitate Conflict:** The primary way to create struggles for characters (a thing needs doing, something stands in the way). Plot, Setting, and Character intersect to create Conflict.
    * **Provide Structure:** Gives the reader a sense of movement, direction, and understanding that a story is being told.

2. **Plot Scales:**
    * **Big P Plot (Capital P):** The overall story concept. What the book is *about* in a sentence or two (e.g., "Destroy the One Ring").
    * **Little p plot (Lowercase p):** Chapter-by-chapter engagement. The smaller problems, obstacles, and resolutions that keep the reader turning pages (e.g., "How do we get past these orcs?").

3. **Innovation & Structure:**
    * Plot is the *hardest* of the core three (Plot, Setting, Character) to innovate on successfully. Readers have ingrained expectations for satisfying story structures.
    * Don't fixate on creating a wholly unique plot structure. Combining familiar structures with unique characters and settings creates freshness (e.g., *Dune* / *Lion King* / *Hamlet* share a core structure but feel distinct).
    * Focus on being a "Chef": Understand *why* plot structures work and use them intentionally.

**II. Promise: Setting Expectations**

1. **What it is:** The setup at the beginning of your story (or section) that tells the reader what kind of experience they are in for and what questions will be answered or goals achieved.
2. **Importance:** Crucial for hooking readers and setting the stage. First few pages/chapter are vital.
3. **When to Perfect:** Often best revised *after* the first draft is complete. It's easier to promise accurately once you know the actual progress and payoff. Don't get stuck perfecting promises upfront (especially discovery writers).
4. **Types of Promises:**
    * **Tone Promise:** Establishes the *feel* of the story (humor, grimdark, epic, whimsical).
        * Achieved through: Prose style, early jokes/tragedy, character/place names (Stark vs. Hogwarts), prologues (common in epic fantasy to show action/stakes before a slower character start). *Warning:* Overused prologues can be cliché.
    * **Structural Promise (Series):** Hints at the scope and continuation.
        * Achieved through: Introducing a group needing resolution (e.g., family needing spouses), explicit labeling (Book 1 of X), overarching stated goal (Wheel of Time), episodic framing (Dresden Files).
    * **Plot Promise (Microcosm/Cold Open):** A mini-story at the start that reflects the larger story's themes, conflicts, or character dynamics. (e.g., *Indiana Jones* opening).
    * **Conflict/Character Promise:** Introduces the central conflict (even metaphorically) or what the character wants/needs and their initial obstacles.
5. **Making New Promises:** Yes, stories (especially longer ones) introduce new promises as they progress (e.g., new character arcs, new subplots). Chapters often have mini-promises.

**III. Progress: The Sense of Movement**

1. **Author Control:** You have *absolute* control over pacing and time. You can spend 50 pages on one second or skip a thousand years.
2. **Goal:** Create a *satisfying sense* of progression towards the promised payoff.
3. **Key Elements:**
    * **Pacing:** How fast the story moves. Varies by genre (thriller vs. character study) and should ideally vary *within* a story (breathers are important). Relentless fast pacing can fatigue the reader, especially in longer works.
    * **Types of Progress & Signposting:** Readers need *visible indicators* that the story is moving forward *towards the promise*.
        * **Information Plot (Mysteries):** Progress = clues discovered, theories tested, suspects eliminated. Signpost via detective's reflections, revealing clues.
        * **Relationship Plot (Romance/Buddy Cop):** Progress = characters overcoming conflict, finding common ground, helping each other. Signpost via interactions, shared moments, changing attitudes.
        * **Adventure/Goal Plot:** Progress = overcoming obstacles, reaching milestones, acquiring tools/allies needed for the goal. Signpost via map-checking, reaching locations, defeating guardians.
    * **Identifying the *Real* Plot:** The surface plot (e.g., get the McGuffin) might be secondary to the thematic/character plot (e.g., become a team). Ensure progress happens on the plot that *matters most* for the payoff. (*Guardians of the Galaxy* example).
4. **Problem: Misaligned Promise & Progress:**
    * **Symptom:** Sections feel boring, readers disengage, subplots feel like detours.
    * **Cause:** The *progress* being shown doesn't connect to the *promises* the reader is invested in.
    * **Sanderson's Oathbringer Example:** Characters promised Destination B, got diverted to C. Readers felt it was a side quest with no progress towards B.
    * **Fix:** Make the *actual* progress (going to C) tie into a compelling *new promise* or reveal its necessity for the original promise (e.g., going to C is vital to save someone).
5. **Skipping Time:** Perfectly acceptable. Use chapter/part breaks or clear indicators ("Three weeks later"). Establish the possibility early.

**IV. Payoff: Fulfilling the Promises**

1. **Goal:** Provide a *surprising yet inevitable* resolution to the promises made.
2. **Achieving "Surprising Yet Inevitable":**
    * **Obstacles & Escalations:** Make the path to the payoff difficult. Raise the stakes. Make the reader doubt success is possible. (*Lord of the Rings* examples: Shelob, Sam carrying Frodo).
    * **Plausible Deniability / Forgetting:** Make the journey so intense or complex that the reader (and characters) temporarily forget an earlier promise, making its fulfillment more impactful. (*Two Towers* film Helm's Deep ending vs. *RotK* film Minas Tirith ending).
    * **Twists:** Change the nature of the payoff.
        * *Not Required:* Satisfying payoffs without twists are common (*Pride & Prejudice*).
        * *Over-Deliver:* Promise a toy car, give a real car.
        * *Change the Desire:* Promise A, make the reader *want* B during the story, deliver B. Requires building investment in B. (*While You Were Sleeping* example).
        * *Subversion:* Promise A, deconstruct A, deliver something else entirely. Risky, needs careful setup to make the audience *want* the subversion (*Into the Woods* example).
3. **Impact:** When Promise, Progress, and Payoff align effectively, it creates emotional resonance (chills, cheers, tears) and reader satisfaction.

**V. Application for Different Writers**

1. **Outliners:** Can use these concepts to structure their outlines, ensuring logical flow and planned payoffs. Still involves discovery writing within the outline points.
2. **Discovery Writers:** Can use these concepts as *diagnostic tools* during revision. If a draft feels flat or readers are confused, analyze the Promises made vs. the Progress shown vs. the intended Payoff. Often, the fix involves adjusting the *Promises* (rewriting the beginning) to match the *Progress* that emerged during discovery writing.

This lecture provides the engine for your plot. Think of Promise as the ignition key and destination programming, Progress as the journey itself (requiring fuel, steering, and milestones), and Payoff as reaching the destination in a satisfying (and maybe unexpected) way.


**Sanderson Lecture 3 Cheatsheet: Plot Frameworks & Models**

This cheatsheet surveys various plot structures discussed in Brandon Sanderson's 2025 Lecture 3, offering tools to experiment with. Remember the core principle: Be a Chef, not a Cook – use these as flexible tools, not rigid formulas.

**I. Foundational Reminders**

1. **Plot Provides Conflict & Progress:**
    * A story isn't just a sequence of events ("The king died"). It's about the struggle and emotional journey ("The king died and then the queen died of grief" - better, but still needs character arc).
    * Progress can be forward or backward (like character backsliding in *Breaking Bad*), as long as the *story* moves towards its goal.

2. **Purposeful Obstacles:** Turn events into meaningful plot points. Obstacles should:
    * **Force Growth:** Push characters or the plot forward, often by removing support (Obi-Wan/Gandalf dying forces protagonists to step up).
    * **Reinforce Learning:** Test or confirm a character's recent breakthrough or the relevance of a discovered clue.
    * **Show Failure:** Highlight a character's flaw, lack of skill, or the villain's competence, proving the problem is difficult and justifying future growth/attempts.

**II. Plot Models & Frameworks (A Survey)**

* **General Caution:** Any framework treated as sacrosanct ("checklist thinking") can harm your story if it doesn't fit naturally. Be willing to adapt or discard parts. Use them to *help* you write, not constrain you unnecessarily.

1. **The Hero's Journey / Monomyth (via Dan Harmon's Story Circle):**
    * **Concept:** Circular journey. Character starts in a zone of comfort/ignorance -> Called to adventure (often resisted) -> Crosses a threshold (point of no return) -> Faces trials & learns -> Confronts divinity/inner darkness/father figure -> Pays a price to gain knowledge/skill ("elixir") -> Returns transformed, mastering both worlds & improving their origin point. It's often about the child becoming the adult.
    * **Pros:** Strong framework for character growth, satisfying payoff through visible change, taps into archetypal story patterns.
    * **Cons:** Can be vague; can be applied too rigidly (Sanderson's *Phantom Menace* "virgin birth" example); Campbell's original work has academic criticisms (sources, overreaching, gender bias).
    * **Use Cases:** Good for coming-of-age, transformation arcs, stories with clear mentorship. Can be layered or used for tragic arcs (refusing a step leads to downfall - *Name of the Wind* speculation).

2. **Yes, But / No, And:**
    * **Concept:** Focuses on *escalation*. Pose a problem/goal -> Does the character achieve it?
        * **Yes, but...** (Success + New Complication)
        * **No, and...** (Failure + New Complication)
    * Drives the story forward by constantly raising stakes or making the situation worse/more complex/more ridiculous.
    * **Pros:** Creates strong forward momentum, tension, and a feeling of spiraling stakes. Excellent for discovery writers letting events cascade. Good for thrillers, comedies, or specific sequences.
    * **Cons:** Can be exhausting in very long novels if not varied. Relies on constant escalation which can feel unsustainable.
    * **Use Cases:** Thrillers, action sequences, screwball comedies, plotting sections between major beats.

3. **Try/Fail Cycles & Points on the Map (Robert Jordan's Method):**
    * **Concept (Points on the Map):** Identify major plot points/events/destinations in advance (like landmarks on a road trip). Discovery-write the journey *between* these points.
    * **Concept (Try/Fail):** Before a character succeeds at a major task, they should *try* intelligent methods and *fail* at least once (often more). Failure should stem from flaws, lack of skill, or being outsmarted, *not* stupidity.
    * **Pros:** Balances structure and discovery. Allows foreshadowing key moments. Try/Fail builds stakes, demonstrates difficulty, justifies character growth, and addresses potential "plot holes" by showing simpler solutions don't work.
    * **Cons:** Requires knowing *some* key endpoints. Can still lead to very long books if the "between points" gets expansive (Wheel of Time example).
    * **Use Cases:** Hybrid outliner/discovery writers. Epic fantasy. Situations where demonstrating the difficulty of a task is important.

4. **Three-Act Structure (Hollywood Model):**
    * **Concept:** Linear structure, like an "arrow pointed at an explosion." Focuses on building conflict towards a climax. (Often feels like 4 acts due to the Midpoint's importance).
        * **Act I (Setup):** Introduce character, status quo, need. Establish the **Major Dramatic Question** (MDQ - *the* key question the story answers). Inciting Incident starts the cascade. Ends with **Plot Point 1** (Point of No Return). (~25% of story)
        * **Act II (Confrontation):** "Throwing rocks." Rising action, obstacles worsen, attempts fail.
            * **Midpoint:** Major turning point. Twist, escalation, reframing, makes it personal. Story shifts significantly. (~50% mark)
            * Continued rising action, stakes increase, leads to the **All is Lost** / Low Point before Act III. (~75% mark)
        * **Act III (Resolution):** Final push. Last chance based on something learned/gained. Climax answers the MDQ (success or failure). Followed by denouement/wrap-up. (~25% of story)
    * **Pros:** Familiar to Western audiences, provides clear structural beats, effective at building to a climax.
    * **Cons:** Can feel formulaic if followed too rigidly (*Save the Cat* critique). Might not fit all story types.
    * **Use Cases:** Mainstream commercial fiction, action/adventure, stories needing a strong, escalating structure. Useful for diagnosing pacing issues.

5. **Structure Model (Analyzing & Adapting Existing Structures):**
    * **Concept:** Choose a specific *sub-genre* or story type you admire (underdog sports story, locked-room mystery, specific heist). Analyze multiple examples to identify common beats, *why* they work, and recurring elements. Distill this into a flexible structure. Adapt that structure to *your* unique story, characters, and genre.
    * **Pros:** Excellent "Chef" practice. Leverages proven, effective structures. Can provide a solid foundation if you struggle with plotting. Adapting across genres creates novelty.
    * **Cons:** Requires research and analytical effort. Risk of imitation if not adapted sufficiently.
    * **Use Cases:** Situations where you admire a particular story *type* and want to understand its engine. When needing a strong structural base. Sanderson's *Way of Kings* Bridge Crew example (underdog sports story -> epic fantasy).

**III. Cross-Cutting Advice**

1. **Tropes:**
    * Don't obsessively avoid them; focus on *execution* and *your voice*.
    * Early work often relies heavily on tropes; mastery involves *consciously using* influences.
    * Reader expectations for tropes vary wildly by genre (e.g., some romance readers *want* listed tropes).
2. **Plot Holes:**
    * Distinguish real issues (things that pull readers out of the story) from nitpicks.
    * Address major issues flagged by beta readers, perhaps by "hanging a lantern" on them (acknowledging the oddity briefly).
    * Accept that perfect realism is impossible; focus on maintaining immersion for *your* story.
3. **The Learning Curve:**
    * New writers can't juggle everything. Focus on fundamentals first (writing consistently, finishing).
    * As basics become instinct, consciously add focus on structure, theme, etc.
    * Use these frameworks as diagnostic tools or for outlining *when you're ready*, don't let them paralyze you early on.

This lecture provides a menu of plotting approaches. Experiment to find what resonates with your style and specific project needs.


**Sanderson Lecture 4 Cheatsheet: Plot Q&A - Clarifications & Applications**

This cheatsheet captures key points from the Q&A session on plot, refining concepts from Lectures 2 & 3 and offering practical advice.

**I. Promises (Expanding Beyond Tone)**

1. **Promise Plot Type (Little p):** Indicate early on the *kind* of journey the reader is embarking on chapter-to-chapter. (Big P plot promise can often wait until ~end of Act I).
2. **Promise Character Approach/Skills:** Show *how* the character solves problems early on, setting expectations for their methods throughout. (e.g., Disney's *Mulan* using wits unconventionally).
3. **Promise Character Arc:** Hint at the character's internal journey – what they want, what they need to overcome, who they will become. (e.g., Disney "I Want" songs).
4. **Promise the Stand-Up-and-Cheer Moment:** Foreshadow future moments of triumph, especially if the character endures significant hardship early on. Helps reader investment. (e.g., *Captain America* – you know the scrawny guy with heart will eventually be powerful).
5. **Chekhov's Gun:** If you highlight an object or detail, readers expect it to be relevant later. Use this intentionally for payoff or subvert it carefully (red herrings).
6. **Promises Drive Engagement:** They are crucial for hooking the reader initially.

**II. Handling Plot Originality**

1. **Don't Overstress (Usually):** Your unique voice and combination of elements will naturally emerge with practice. Focus on telling *your* story well.
2. **If It's a Persistent Problem (Feedback-Validated):**
    * **Force the Next Step:** Identify the expected trope/beat and deliberately choose a *different*, earned path that deepens the story. (Sanderson's *Way of Kings Prime* vs. final Kaladin example). *Warning:* Twist for the *story's* benefit, not just shock value.
    * **Transpose Genre/Setting:** Take a familiar plot structure and apply it in a completely new context, letting the new genre conventions reshape it. (e.g., *10 Things I Hate About You* - Shakespearean comedy in high school).
    * **Deconstruct:** Analyze the flaws or assumptions of a common plot and build your story around exploring/inverting them. (*Mistborn* origin: "What if the Dark Lord won?"). *Secret:* Effective deconstruction often still uses the *mechanics* of the original tropes in new ways.
3. **Deconstruction Warning:** If you heavily subvert expectations late in the story, clearly signal the *type* of story it is early on (through tone, early hints) to attract the right audience and avoid frustrating those expecting the standard trope. (Anecdote about the author deconstructing quest fantasy).

**III. Execution Details: Exposition, Foreshadowing, Twists, Climaxes**

1. **Exposition:**
    * **Definition:** Bringing the reader up to speed on world details, magic, backstory, etc.
    * **Learning Curve:** Sci-Fi/Fantasy often has a steep curve. Your job is to make it manageable.
    * **Common Mistakes:** Info dumps (especially early), "As You Know, Bob" / Maiden & Butler dialogue (characters telling each other things they both already know for the audience's benefit).
    * **Good Practices:**
        * **Integrate, Don't Dump:** Weave details into action, dialogue, and character perspective.
        * **Make it Relevant:** Exposition lands better if it's crucial *to the characters* in that moment.
        * **Show, Don't Just Tell (Implied):** Ground exposition in concrete scenes/interactions (Tolkien showing dwarves/wizards by having them annoy Bilbo).
        * **"Spinach in the Smoothie":** Deliver exposition so seamlessly the reader doesn't realize they're learning world details.
        * **Start Small:** Introduce only what's necessary early on.
    * **Handling Steep Curves:** Lengthening the intro (e.g., starting "in our world" like Portal Fantasy) can work but risks boredom. Better: Craft compelling early scenes that establish character/stakes *while* subtly introducing necessary world elements.

2. **Foreshadowing & Twists:**
    * **Foreshadowing is Easy to Revise:** Don't stress it on the first draft, especially for discovery writers. Add/adjust hints ("turn the knob") during revision based on beta reader feedback.
    * **Goal:** Aim for the twist to feel *surprising yet inevitable*. Most readers should ideally guess it just before the reveal.
    * **If Everyone Guesses Too Early:** Dial back foreshadowing OR lean into it and create suspense (Hitchcock method - audience knows, characters don't).
    * **If No One Guesses:** Foreshadowing might be too obscure. A twist no one *could* see often feels unearned (complications are different).
    * **Reader Psychology:** Research suggests people often enjoy stories *more* if they know the twists beforehand (reduces anxiety, allows focus on execution). Don't drastically change established foreshadowing just because some readers figured it out.
    * **Shock Value Twists:** Can work if they serve the theme and lead to interesting character reactions (*Game of Thrones* example). Avoid shock for shock's sake.

3. **Climaxes & Pacing:**
    * **Overlapping Arcs Climaxing:**
        * Aim for *Internal* resolution (character decision/growth) triggering/enabling the *External* resolution (plot action). (Han returning -> Luke trusting Force -> Death Star destroyed).
        * Stagger climaxes if too many happen at once (numbness to awesome). Resolve some arcs earlier to allow focus on the main finale. (Sanderson's Wheel of Time approach).
    * **Post-Climax Dip:** If a midpoint feels stronger than the ending:
        * Can you move the midpoint climax to the end?
        * Can you escalate the *final* climax to make it even stronger?
        * Sometimes, accept the structural "quirk" if the narrative/emotional journey feels right (*Tress* example).
    * **Longer Resolutions:** Often acceptable, even liked by readers, if the story earns it. Don't feel rigidly bound if lingering feels right for *your* story (*Return of the King*, *Dark Knight* examples).

**IV. Process & Structure**

1. **Choosing a Plotting Method:** Lean into what has worked before. If exploring (new writers), try extremes (heavy outline vs. pure discovery) to find your preference, then mix.
2. **Sanderson's Outline Method (Brief):**
    * Identify major plotlines (external plot, character arcs, romance, info/mystery).
    * Brainstorm key moments/progress points/payoffs for *each* plotline as separate lists.
    * Weave these bullet points together chronologically into sections/parts, ensuring logical flow and progression across all lines. (Uses Word's document map).
3. **Handling Failure Endings:** Make sure the failure feels earned/thematic.
    * "They deserved it" (Tragedy/Character Flaw driven - *Butch Cassidy*).
    * "They weren't strong enough, but maybe next time" (Series setup - *Empire Strikes Back*).
    * Bittersweet victory (some goals met, others lost, provides hope/promise - *Fellowship* ending).
4. **Memory Loss Plots:** Rely heavily on engaging *little p* problem-solving that reveals *big P* plot details gradually. Use flashbacks strategically. (*Project Hail Mary* recommended).
5. **Consistency for Discovery Writers:** Fix foreshadowing and internal consistency issues during revision ("Fix it in post").

**V. Feedback**

1. **Beta Readers on Plot/Pacing:** Ask "Where were you bored?" "Where did you want to put it down?" Use this to identify slow sections.
2. **Writing Groups:** Be cautious of pacing feedback from groups reading in chunks. They are better for other types of feedback.

This Q&A adds layers of practical application and nuance to the plot frameworks, emphasizing flexibility, revision, and understanding reader expectation.


**Sanderson Lecture 4.5 Cheatsheet: Plot Q&A - Deeper Dives & Specific Arcs**

This cheatsheet covers clarifications and deeper discussions on plot points raised in the web-exclusive Q&A session following the main plot lectures.

**I. Specific Plot Arcs & Endings**

1. **Writing Betrayal Arcs:**
    * **Foundation:** Treat it like a Relationship Plot initially. Establish a strong bond and show *why* the characters work well together.
    * **The Turn:** Instead of overcoming conflict, show motivations diverging, minor conflicts escalating, and "roses stabbing each other." Subtly seed the reasons for the eventual betrayal.
    * **Perspective is Key:** Use the POV character's trust/belief in the friend to mask the warning signs from the reader. The reader follows the POV's attention.
    * **Motivation Matters:** Ensure the betrayer has a solid, understandable (even if not agreeable) reason for their actions.
    * **Payoff:** Aim for the "surprising yet inevitable" quality of a good twist. Foreshadow the *relationship*, but hide the *breakdown*.

2. **Balancing Bittersweet Endings:**
    * **Signal Early:** Indicate through tone, setting hardship, or early casualties that a purely happy ending isn't guaranteed.
    * **Gauge with Beta Readers:** Monitor feedback to see if the balance feels right. Adjust elements to emphasize sweet or bitter as needed.
    * **Internal vs. External Achievement:**
        * *More Sweet:* Character achieves personal growth/internal goal, even if the Big P Plot fails.
        * *More Bitter:* Big P Plot succeeds, but at a high personal cost to the character (e.g., Frodo in *Lord of the Rings*).
        * *Triumphant (even in death):* Character achieves personal goal/fulfills arc *while* accomplishing the Big P Plot, even if they die in the process.

3. **Try/Succeed Cycles (vs. Try/Fail):** (Why *Dune* works)
    * **Context is Crucial:** It *can* work effectively, it's not inherently wrong.
    * **Initial Failure:** Often still features a significant early failure (Paul's exile).
    * **Tragic Framing:** Successes can contribute to an overall tragic arc (Paul becoming a vengeful leader). The reader's *desire* for the success might wane as they see the consequences.
    * **Competence Porn:** Readers enjoy watching highly competent characters succeed against difficult odds (*Dirk Pitt* example). Make the stakes high, the threats dire, and the execution skillful.
    * **Expanding Scope:** Success can lead to the realization that the *true* challenge is much larger, justifying continued effort (Frodo reaching Rivendell only to realize the journey must continue).

**II. Crafting Techniques**

1. **Layering Internal & External Conflict:**
    * **Goal:** Make scenes more dynamic by having the character's internal struggle (flaw, goal, fear) interact with the external plot problem.
    * **Mechanism:**
        * Show the internal flaw causing external complications or failures.
        * Ensure the flaw is relatable and the character remains sympathetic (show acknowledgement/struggle).
        * Use internal breakthroughs/decisions to enable external successes (The "one-two punch" - internal win unlocks external win).
        * Show progress on both fronts throughout the story, not just batched separately.

2. **Plotting Advantages of Books vs. Movies:**
    * **Interiority:** Direct access to character thoughts/feelings allows deeper connection and more nuanced exposition. *Use judiciously to avoid "navel-gazing."*
    * **Space & Pacing:** More room for subplots, side characters, gradual reveals, more try/fail cycles, slower burns, meandering exploration. Pacing can be tailored for multi-session reading (vs. film's typically shorter, intense structure).
    * **Reader Participation:** Lack of visuals *requires* reader imagination, making them more active participants. Allows for broader brushstrokes in description, relying on the reader to fill gaps.
    * **Plotting Impact:** Enables more complex twists, more red herrings, and potentially more spectacular payoffs due to the greater buildup possible.

3. **Using Plot Archetypes & Combinations:** (Reinforces Structure Model)
    * **Analyze & Distill:** Study examples within a specific archetype (e.g., Heist) to understand variations (e.g., *Italian Job* disruption vs. *Ocean's 11* execution).
    * **Mix & Match:** Combine multiple archetypes within a novel (*Mistborn*: Heist + Master/Apprentice + Mystery + Romance + Revolution).
    * **Transition:** Skillfully shift between archetypes as the plot demands (*Knives Out*: Whodunit -> Cat & Mouse). This is advanced "Chef" work.
    * **Swap Genres:** Applying archetypes across genres creates freshness.

**III. Practical Considerations**

1. **Writing for Video Games (Brief):**
    * **Player Agency:** Plot must account for player choice/control, which varies greatly by game genre.
    * **Integrate Mechanics & Narrative:** The strongest stories often tie plot directly to gameplay (e.g., diagetic respawns in *Borderlands*).
    * **Earn Payoffs:** If player choice is the payoff (*Mass Effect*), ensure emotional investment (e.g., well-developed companions) to give choices weight.
    * **Beware Ludonarrative Dissonance:** Avoid plot points (like permanent death in cutscenes) that contradict established game mechanics (like easy resurrection).

2. **Deciding Story Scale (Length):**
    * **Experience Helps:** Develops intuition for how long a story "needs" to be.
    * **Word Count Thresholds (Rough Guides):**
        * *< 120k words:* Easier to maintain tight focus, often suited for single-sitting reads (thrillers, romance).
        * *> 120k-150k words:* Readers generally expect expanded scope (world-saving, generational, full life).
    * **Reader Experience:** Longer books accommodate multi-session reading, requiring different pacing (e.g., satisfying chapter endings, managing info recall). Shorter books can sustain faster, more relentless pacing.
    * **Match Length to Scope:** Ensure the story's depth/breadth justifies the length.

This Q&A provides valuable nuance, especially regarding handling non-standard plot trajectories (betrayal, bittersweet, try/succeed) and leveraging the unique strengths of the novel format for plotting.


**Sanderson Lecture 5 Cheatsheet: Compelling Characters - Proactive, Relatable, Capable**

This cheatsheet covers the foundational principles for creating compelling characters as discussed in Brandon Sanderson's 2025 Lecture 5.

**I. The Core Problem & Sanderson's Framework**

1. **The Gap:** University writing courses often fail to teach *how* to make characters compelling.
2. **Sanderson's Goal:** Provide a practical framework for creating interesting characters.
3. **The Framework (CPR):** Compelling characters often excel through a combination of being:
    * **P**roactive
    * **R**elatable
    * **C**apable
4. **The Balance:**
    * Most characters *don't* max out all three.
    * A common pattern: High in one, low in another, *growing* in the third.
    * Think of these as sliding scales that can change throughout the story (character arcs).

**II. Proactivity: Making the Story Happen**

1. **Definition:** The character takes action, makes decisions, and drives the plot forward. This is arguably the *single most important* factor for reader engagement.
2. **Why it Works:** Readers bond with characters who cause progress. Inaction or stalling leads to frustration.
3. **Examples:**
    * **Jack (Lost):** Highly proactive (takes charge after crash), not initially relatable, but instantly compelling because he *acts*.
    * **Mulan (Disney):** Shows proactivity early in *her own sphere* (cleverly feeding chickens) before the main plot, signaling her problem-solving nature.
4. **The Villain Problem:** Often, villains are more proactive than heroes (especially in origin stories), making them unintentionally more interesting.
5. **Cultivating Proactivity (Even in Passive Characters):**
    * **Give Them a Want (Kurt Vonnegut):** Even a small desire (a cup of coffee - *Hudson Hawk*) gives the character immediate agency and direction.
    * **Clear Motivations:** Define *why* the character acts. Weak or unclear motivations make characters feel wooden. Multiple, even contradictory, motivations are realistic.
    * **Show Agency Within Limits:** If externally constrained (prison), show them *trying* things, planning, or acting within their small sphere.
    * **Focus on Motion (vs. Stasis):** Even downward motion (sliding into depression while *actively* searching/failing - Sazed) is more engaging than static inaction. Mental health struggles making characters purely static are challenging to write compellingly.
    * **Competing Proactivity:** Multiple characters with opposing proactive goals creates excellent tension (*The Fugitive* - Cat and Mouse).

**III. Relatability: Creating Connection & Likability**

1. **Definition:** The qualities that make readers like, understand, or empathize with a character. Crucial for raising stakes.
2. **Methods:**
    * **Save the Cat:** Show kindness, empathy, helping others (even animals). Establishes basic moral decency. ("Kick the Dog" establishes villains).
    * **Liked by Others:** Show positive regard from other characters. We naturally trust others' judgment. (Using non-POV to introduce Kaladin).
    * **Self-Awareness:** Characters who recognize and acknowledge their flaws (even if they struggle to overcome them) gain empathy (Mr. Darcy).
    * **Common Ground:** Give them everyday struggles, desires, or relatable flaws (hating Mondays, liking lasagna, struggling with a subject).
    * **Moral Compass:** Align their core values generally with the audience's.
    * **Quirks:** Unique traits that make them individuals and potentially break stereotypes. Best when they expand character rather than being random.
    * **Flaws (Initial Boost):** Showing a flaw initially increases relatability, but becomes a liability if the character never addresses it (Luke initially refusing the call vs. continuing refusal).
3. **Villain Relatability:** A touch of relatable motivation or backstory can make villains much stronger (Magneto's fear). Can involve a downward trajectory from a relatable start (Spider-Man villains).
4. **Antiheroes:**
    * *Classical:* Non-proactive protagonist (Madame Bovary).
    * *Modern Pop Culture:* Morally gray character fighting worse people. High P & C, lower R. Often involves exploring moral complexities (Grimdark) or simply providing wish fulfillment (John Wick, Punisher).
5. **The "Michael Problem" (Lost):** Avoid making a single (even relatable) motivation so all-consuming and repetitive that it becomes annoying and defines the character solely.

**IV. Capability: Competence & Skill**

1. **Definition:** Being good at something, effective, competent.
2. **Why it Works:** We admire competence. Watching experts is inherently engaging ("competence porn" - *Dirk Pitt*).
3. **Balance:**
    * Too much capability can decrease relatability (making Bond more vulnerable in *Casino Royale*).
    * Typically, characters are good at some things, weak at others. Strengths drive plot initially, weaknesses create conflict later.
4. **Types of Capability:** Not just physical/combat skills. Loyalty (*Samwise Gamgee*), intelligence, wit, specific knowledge, etc.
5. **Interaction with Flaws/Limitations/Restrictions:** (Preview of Sanderson's Second Law)
    * **Flaw:** Internal issue needing to be overcome (provides arc).
    * **Restriction:** Self/Story-imposed limit that *shouldn't* be overcome (Superman's code). Creates conflict through limitation.
    * **Limitation:** External constraint to be worked *around* (physical disability). Story is about adaptation, not fixing.

**V. Character Arcs**

1. **Definition:** Movement along the CPR scales.
2. **Common Arcs:**
    * Gaining Capability (Apprentice to Master).
    * Gaining Relatability (Overcoming a flaw).
    * Gaining Proactivity (Moving from reactive to active).
    * *Downward arcs* are also possible (moving down on relatability/capability, becoming a villain).

**VI. Related Advice**

1. **Write What You Know (Passion):** Use your unique knowledge, hobbies, passions, or life experiences to inform characters, plots, or worlds. This adds authenticity and depth (Dan Wells/serial killers example).
2. **Character Tropes:** Use them as shorthand/starting points, but add unique quirks and depth to break the mold and create individuality. Readers will often pigeonhole initially; your job is to show the character is more complex.

This lecture provides the fundamental building blocks (CPR) for creating characters that readers will invest in, root for (or against), and remember. The key is balancing these elements and showing change (arcs) over time.
