**Sanderson Lecture 1 Cheatsheet: Foundations & Philosophy**

This cheatsheet covers the introductory concepts and philosophical underpinnings discussed in Brandon Sanderson's 2025 Lecture 1.

**I. Core Philosophy & Approach**

1. **Be a Chef, Not a Cook:**
    * **Cook:** Follows recipes blindly. Can make *a* dish, but doesn't understand *why* it works or how to fix it if it fails.
    * **Chef:** Understands the *principles* behind the ingredients and techniques. Can adapt, create, diagnose problems, and innovate.
    * **Goal:** Learn the tools and *why* they work, so you can apply them effectively, adapt them, or even discard them consciously for *your* specific story and goals.

2. **Writing Advice is Subjective:**
    * What works for one writer (or even one project) might not work for another.
    * Expect to receive advice (even from Sanderson) that is *bad for you* specifically, or bad for you *right now*.
    * Your job is to experiment, learn what helps *you*, and build your own process.

3. **The Value of Writing (Professional vs. Hobbyist):**
    * Writing is intrinsically valuable for the artist ("making the artist's life more enriched"). Don't let external pressure ("Are you published?") diminish this.
    * It's okay (and wonderful) to be a non-professional writer.
    * **Class Assumption:** For the purpose of the lectures, assume the goal is to become a full-time professional SF/F novelist within ~10 years. This broad goal encompasses advice applicable to all writers.

4. **Artist vs. Mercenary Mindset:**
    * **During Writing:** The *Artist* is in charge. Make decisions based on what's best for the story and characters, maintaining artistic integrity.
    * **After Finishing:** The *Mercenary* takes over. Figure out the smartest, most effective (legal) ways to get the book to an audience and potentially earn from it, *without compromising the original artistic integrity*. The business side supports the art side.

**II. Writer Archetypes: Finding Your Process**

1. **Architect (Outliner):**
    * Builds a detailed structure/plan (like blueprints) before writing.
    * Knows where the story is going.
    * *Potential Pitfall:* Can feel the story is "already told," losing enthusiasm for the drafting. May skip revision because the *next* outlined book is more exciting. (Sanderson leans this way).

2. **Gardener (Discovery Writer / "Pantser"):**
    * Nurtures the story as it grows, discovering it along the way.
    * Relies on intuition and exploration during drafting.
    * *Potential Pitfall:* Can revise early chapters endlessly without finishing. Can get lost or write into corners. Can be easily swayed/derailed by early feedback. (Stephen King leans this way).

3. **The Reality:** Most writers are a *mix* ("Frankenstein monster"). You need to experiment to find where you fall on the spectrum and what each *project* requires. Your process will likely evolve over your career.

**III. Early Career Strategy: The First Books**

1. **Goal:** Learn Your Process & Build Skill. Your primary job isn't to sell your first books; it's to *learn* by writing them.
    * "The product of your writing time is you. You are the piece of art."

2. **Finish Multiple Books:** Expect to write several novels before you're publishable or hit your stride. (Sanderson mentions 3-5, sold his 6th; Dan Wells sold his 6th; Rachel sold her 7th).
    * Don't get stuck on Book 1 perfection.

3. **Embrace the "Ugly Baby":** Your early work likely won't match the vision in your head. Your skill needs time to catch up to your taste/aspirations. *Push through and finish anyway.* This is normal.

4. **Revise Your Early Books:** Revision is a separate, critical skill. Don't skip it, even on early work you don't plan to publish. Practice revision just like you practice drafting.
    * *Outliner Trap:* Thinking the next book will be better, so skipping revision.
    * *Discovery Writer Trap:* Revising endlessly without finishing a draft.

5. **Ideas are Cheap, Execution is Key:** Don't be afraid to "waste" ideas on practice novels. Great execution can make almost *any* idea work (Jim Butcher example: Pok√©mon + Lost Roman Legion = Codex Alera). Skilled writing is instantly recognizable.

6. **Same World Gambit:** It's fine to write multiple early books in the same world to leverage worldbuilding.
    * *Safer:* Standalone stories in the same setting.
    * *Riskier (but potential high reward):* Writing sequels before Book 1 sells (like Naomi Novik's Temeraire). If Book 1 doesn't sell, the sequels are harder to place. If it *does* sell big, having sequels ready is a huge advantage.

**IV. Motivation & Overcoming Challenges**

1. **Find Your Drive:** Understand what motivates *you*.
    * Intrinsic enjoyment (losing track of time).
    * External tracking (Sanderson's word count spreadsheet).
    * Habit bundling (linking writing/revision to existing habits).
    * Carrots vs. Sticks.
    * Binge vs. Consistent Small Bites.

2. **Dealing with Doubt/The Long Haul:**
    * Acknowledge the difficulty of "going pro" (maybe 1 in 20 from a dedicated group). Have realistic expectations but don't be paralyzed.
    * Make the internal decision: Are you a writer regardless of external success? (Sanderson's "belly of the whale" moment).
    * Survivorship Bias: Be aware that successful people's advice isn't a guaranteed path. Focus on gathering *tools*, not just following one person's story.

3. **Making Yourself Revise:**
    * Treat it as a skill to learn.
    * Make a plan/outline for the revision (like a bug list in programming). Target specific problems.
    * Get feedback (see Writing Groups) to inform the revision plan.
    * Use habit-building techniques (bundling, scheduling).

**V. Writing Groups & Feedback**

1. **Purpose:** A tool to get test audience reactions and practice processing feedback. Not for everyone, can be detrimental if misused.

2. **Key Rules for Success:**
    * **Discovery Writers:** Be very cautious about sharing work *before* a draft is finished. Early feedback can derail your discovery process.
    * **Receiving Feedback:**
        * Be a "fly on the wall." *Listen* and *take notes*.
        * Resist the urge to defend, explain, or argue. This skews the feedback.
        * Process the feedback *later*, when you're emotionally detached and in a revision mindset.
        * Expect to use only a portion (Sanderson uses ~1/3). Look for patterns.
    * **Giving Feedback:**
        * Be **Descriptive, Not Prescriptive.**
        * Describe *your experience* as a reader ("I felt confused here," "This character felt flat to me," "I was excited at this part").
        * Do *not* try to rewrite or "fix" the author's book ("You should add X," "Change the ending to Y"). Your job is to report your reaction, not be the editor.

This structure provides a solid starting point based *only* on Lecture 1. As you process subsequent lectures, you can add new sections (e.g., Plotting Tools, Character Arcs, Worldbuilding Techniques, Business Nuts & Bolts) and flesh out these foundational concepts with more specific tools and examples Sanderson provides.
