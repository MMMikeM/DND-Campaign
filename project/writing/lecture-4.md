**Sanderson Lecture 4 Cheatsheet: Plot Q&A - Clarifications & Applications**

This cheatsheet captures key points from the Q&A session on plot, refining concepts from Lectures 2 & 3 and offering practical advice.

**I. Promises (Expanding Beyond Tone)**

1. **Promise Plot Type (Little p):** Indicate early on the *kind* of journey the reader is embarking on chapter-to-chapter. (Big P plot promise can often wait until ~end of Act I).
2. **Promise Character Approach/Skills:** Show *how* the character solves problems early on, setting expectations for their methods throughout. (e.g., Disney's *Mulan* using wits unconventionally).
3. **Promise Character Arc:** Hint at the character's internal journey – what they want, what they need to overcome, who they will become. (e.g., Disney "I Want" songs).
4. **Promise the Stand-Up-and-Cheer Moment:** Foreshadow future moments of triumph, especially if the character endures significant hardship early on. Helps reader investment. (e.g., *Captain America* – you know the scrawny guy with heart will eventually be powerful).
5. **Chekhov's Gun:** If you highlight an object or detail, readers expect it to be relevant later. Use this intentionally for payoff or subvert it carefully (red herrings).
6. **Promises Drive Engagement:** They are crucial for hooking the reader initially.

**II. Handling Plot Originality**

1. **Don't Overstress (Usually):** Your unique voice and combination of elements will naturally emerge with practice. Focus on telling *your* story well.
2. **If It's a Persistent Problem (Feedback-Validated):**
    * **Force the Next Step:** Identify the expected trope/beat and deliberately choose a *different*, earned path that deepens the story. (Sanderson's *Way of Kings Prime* vs. final Kaladin example). *Warning:* Twist for the *story's* benefit, not just shock value.
    * **Transpose Genre/Setting:** Take a familiar plot structure and apply it in a completely new context, letting the new genre conventions reshape it. (e.g., *10 Things I Hate About You* - Shakespearean comedy in high school).
    * **Deconstruct:** Analyze the flaws or assumptions of a common plot and build your story around exploring/inverting them. (*Mistborn* origin: "What if the Dark Lord won?"). *Secret:* Effective deconstruction often still uses the *mechanics* of the original tropes in new ways.
3. **Deconstruction Warning:** If you heavily subvert expectations late in the story, clearly signal the *type* of story it is early on (through tone, early hints) to attract the right audience and avoid frustrating those expecting the standard trope. (Anecdote about the author deconstructing quest fantasy).

**III. Execution Details: Exposition, Foreshadowing, Twists, Climaxes**

1. **Exposition:**
    * **Definition:** Bringing the reader up to speed on world details, magic, backstory, etc.
    * **Learning Curve:** Sci-Fi/Fantasy often has a steep curve. Your job is to make it manageable.
    * **Common Mistakes:** Info dumps (especially early), "As You Know, Bob" / Maiden & Butler dialogue (characters telling each other things they both already know for the audience's benefit).
    * **Good Practices:**
        * **Integrate, Don't Dump:** Weave details into action, dialogue, and character perspective.
        * **Make it Relevant:** Exposition lands better if it's crucial *to the characters* in that moment.
        * **Show, Don't Just Tell (Implied):** Ground exposition in concrete scenes/interactions (Tolkien showing dwarves/wizards by having them annoy Bilbo).
        * **"Spinach in the Smoothie":** Deliver exposition so seamlessly the reader doesn't realize they're learning world details.
        * **Start Small:** Introduce only what's necessary early on.
    * **Handling Steep Curves:** Lengthening the intro (e.g., starting "in our world" like Portal Fantasy) can work but risks boredom. Better: Craft compelling early scenes that establish character/stakes *while* subtly introducing necessary world elements.

2. **Foreshadowing & Twists:**
    * **Foreshadowing is Easy to Revise:** Don't stress it on the first draft, especially for discovery writers. Add/adjust hints ("turn the knob") during revision based on beta reader feedback.
    * **Goal:** Aim for the twist to feel *surprising yet inevitable*. Most readers should ideally guess it just before the reveal.
    * **If Everyone Guesses Too Early:** Dial back foreshadowing OR lean into it and create suspense (Hitchcock method - audience knows, characters don't).
    * **If No One Guesses:** Foreshadowing might be too obscure. A twist no one *could* see often feels unearned (complications are different).
    * **Reader Psychology:** Research suggests people often enjoy stories *more* if they know the twists beforehand (reduces anxiety, allows focus on execution). Don't drastically change established foreshadowing just because some readers figured it out.
    * **Shock Value Twists:** Can work if they serve the theme and lead to interesting character reactions (*Game of Thrones* example). Avoid shock for shock's sake.

3. **Climaxes & Pacing:**
    * **Overlapping Arcs Climaxing:**
        * Aim for *Internal* resolution (character decision/growth) triggering/enabling the *External* resolution (plot action). (Han returning -> Luke trusting Force -> Death Star destroyed).
        * Stagger climaxes if too many happen at once (numbness to awesome). Resolve some arcs earlier to allow focus on the main finale. (Sanderson's Wheel of Time approach).
    * **Post-Climax Dip:** If a midpoint feels stronger than the ending:
        * Can you move the midpoint climax to the end?
        * Can you escalate the *final* climax to make it even stronger?
        * Sometimes, accept the structural "quirk" if the narrative/emotional journey feels right (*Tress* example).
    * **Longer Resolutions:** Often acceptable, even liked by readers, if the story earns it. Don't feel rigidly bound if lingering feels right for *your* story (*Return of the King*, *Dark Knight* examples).

**IV. Process & Structure**

1. **Choosing a Plotting Method:** Lean into what has worked before. If exploring (new writers), try extremes (heavy outline vs. pure discovery) to find your preference, then mix.
2. **Sanderson's Outline Method (Brief):**
    * Identify major plotlines (external plot, character arcs, romance, info/mystery).
    * Brainstorm key moments/progress points/payoffs for *each* plotline as separate lists.
    * Weave these bullet points together chronologically into sections/parts, ensuring logical flow and progression across all lines. (Uses Word's document map).
3. **Handling Failure Endings:** Make sure the failure feels earned/thematic.
    * "They deserved it" (Tragedy/Character Flaw driven - *Butch Cassidy*).
    * "They weren't strong enough, but maybe next time" (Series setup - *Empire Strikes Back*).
    * Bittersweet victory (some goals met, others lost, provides hope/promise - *Fellowship* ending).
4. **Memory Loss Plots:** Rely heavily on engaging *little p* problem-solving that reveals *big P* plot details gradually. Use flashbacks strategically. (*Project Hail Mary* recommended).
5. **Consistency for Discovery Writers:** Fix foreshadowing and internal consistency issues during revision ("Fix it in post").

**V. Feedback**

1. **Beta Readers on Plot/Pacing:** Ask "Where were you bored?" "Where did you want to put it down?" Use this to identify slow sections.
2. **Writing Groups:** Be cautious of pacing feedback from groups reading in chunks. They are better for other types of feedback.

This Q&A adds layers of practical application and nuance to the plot frameworks, emphasizing flexibility, revision, and understanding reader expectation.
