**Sanderson Lecture 5 Cheatsheet: Compelling Characters - Proactive, Relatable, Capable**

This cheatsheet covers the foundational principles for creating compelling characters as discussed in Brandon Sanderson's 2025 Lecture 5.

**I. The Core Problem & Sanderson's Framework**

1. **The Gap:** University writing courses often fail to teach *how* to make characters compelling.
2. **Sanderson's Goal:** Provide a practical framework for creating interesting characters.
3. **The Framework (CPR):** Compelling characters often excel through a combination of being:
    * **P**roactive
    * **R**elatable
    * **C**apable
4. **The Balance:**
    * Most characters *don't* max out all three.
    * A common pattern: High in one, low in another, *growing* in the third.
    * Think of these as sliding scales that can change throughout the story (character arcs).

**II. Proactivity: Making the Story Happen**

1. **Definition:** The character takes action, makes decisions, and drives the plot forward. This is arguably the *single most important* factor for reader engagement.
2. **Why it Works:** Readers bond with characters who cause progress. Inaction or stalling leads to frustration.
3. **Examples:**
    * **Jack (Lost):** Highly proactive (takes charge after crash), not initially relatable, but instantly compelling because he *acts*.
    * **Mulan (Disney):** Shows proactivity early in *her own sphere* (cleverly feeding chickens) before the main plot, signaling her problem-solving nature.
4. **The Villain Problem:** Often, villains are more proactive than heroes (especially in origin stories), making them unintentionally more interesting.
5. **Cultivating Proactivity (Even in Passive Characters):**
    * **Give Them a Want (Kurt Vonnegut):** Even a small desire (a cup of coffee - *Hudson Hawk*) gives the character immediate agency and direction.
    * **Clear Motivations:** Define *why* the character acts. Weak or unclear motivations make characters feel wooden. Multiple, even contradictory, motivations are realistic.
    * **Show Agency Within Limits:** If externally constrained (prison), show them *trying* things, planning, or acting within their small sphere.
    * **Focus on Motion (vs. Stasis):** Even downward motion (sliding into depression while *actively* searching/failing - Sazed) is more engaging than static inaction. Mental health struggles making characters purely static are challenging to write compellingly.
    * **Competing Proactivity:** Multiple characters with opposing proactive goals creates excellent tension (*The Fugitive* - Cat and Mouse).

**III. Relatability: Creating Connection & Likability**

1. **Definition:** The qualities that make readers like, understand, or empathize with a character. Crucial for raising stakes.
2. **Methods:**
    * **Save the Cat:** Show kindness, empathy, helping others (even animals). Establishes basic moral decency. ("Kick the Dog" establishes villains).
    * **Liked by Others:** Show positive regard from other characters. We naturally trust others' judgment. (Using non-POV to introduce Kaladin).
    * **Self-Awareness:** Characters who recognize and acknowledge their flaws (even if they struggle to overcome them) gain empathy (Mr. Darcy).
    * **Common Ground:** Give them everyday struggles, desires, or relatable flaws (hating Mondays, liking lasagna, struggling with a subject).
    * **Moral Compass:** Align their core values generally with the audience's.
    * **Quirks:** Unique traits that make them individuals and potentially break stereotypes. Best when they expand character rather than being random.
    * **Flaws (Initial Boost):** Showing a flaw initially increases relatability, but becomes a liability if the character never addresses it (Luke initially refusing the call vs. continuing refusal).
3. **Villain Relatability:** A touch of relatable motivation or backstory can make villains much stronger (Magneto's fear). Can involve a downward trajectory from a relatable start (Spider-Man villains).
4. **Antiheroes:**
    * *Classical:* Non-proactive protagonist (Madame Bovary).
    * *Modern Pop Culture:* Morally gray character fighting worse people. High P & C, lower R. Often involves exploring moral complexities (Grimdark) or simply providing wish fulfillment (John Wick, Punisher).
5. **The "Michael Problem" (Lost):** Avoid making a single (even relatable) motivation so all-consuming and repetitive that it becomes annoying and defines the character solely.

**IV. Capability: Competence & Skill**

1. **Definition:** Being good at something, effective, competent.
2. **Why it Works:** We admire competence. Watching experts is inherently engaging ("competence porn" - *Dirk Pitt*).
3. **Balance:**
    * Too much capability can decrease relatability (making Bond more vulnerable in *Casino Royale*).
    * Typically, characters are good at some things, weak at others. Strengths drive plot initially, weaknesses create conflict later.
4. **Types of Capability:** Not just physical/combat skills. Loyalty (*Samwise Gamgee*), intelligence, wit, specific knowledge, etc.
5. **Interaction with Flaws/Limitations/Restrictions:** (Preview of Sanderson's Second Law)
    * **Flaw:** Internal issue needing to be overcome (provides arc).
    * **Restriction:** Self/Story-imposed limit that *shouldn't* be overcome (Superman's code). Creates conflict through limitation.
    * **Limitation:** External constraint to be worked *around* (physical disability). Story is about adaptation, not fixing.

**V. Character Arcs**

1. **Definition:** Movement along the CPR scales.
2. **Common Arcs:**
    * Gaining Capability (Apprentice to Master).
    * Gaining Relatability (Overcoming a flaw).
    * Gaining Proactivity (Moving from reactive to active).
    * *Downward arcs* are also possible (moving down on relatability/capability, becoming a villain).

**VI. Related Advice**

1. **Write What You Know (Passion):** Use your unique knowledge, hobbies, passions, or life experiences to inform characters, plots, or worlds. This adds authenticity and depth (Dan Wells/serial killers example).
2. **Character Tropes:** Use them as shorthand/starting points, but add unique quirks and depth to break the mold and create individuality. Readers will often pigeonhole initially; your job is to show the character is more complex.

This lecture provides the fundamental building blocks (CPR) for creating characters that readers will invest in, root for (or against), and remember. The key is balancing these elements and showing change (arcs) over time.
