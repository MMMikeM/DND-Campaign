When working in react projects, prefer 

react-icons
shad-cn

Do not change any shad-cn components unless explicitly requested - these exist in packages/react/app/components/ui

Custom components are created in packages/react/app/components 

When the warranted, if multiple files are needed per component, folders can be created in the components folder
