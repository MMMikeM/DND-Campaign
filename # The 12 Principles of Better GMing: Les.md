# The 12 Principles of Better GMing: Lessons from Dungeon World

Based on the information provided, here are the 12 core principles for becoming a better gamemaster, inspired by Dungeon World but applicable to any tabletop roleplaying game:

## 1. Draw Maps, Leave Blanks
**Description:** Create physical maps for your world but intentionally leave spaces undefined.

**Explanation:** This approach prevents GM burnout by not requiring you to plan everything. It allows the story to develop naturally through play and leaves room for player agency and improvisation.

**Example:** Rather than detailing every shop and NPC in a city district, sketch the major landmarks and fill in the rest as players explore. When a player asks "Is there a blacksmith nearby?" you can decide on the spot without contradicting established lore.

## 2. Address the Characters, Not the Players
**Description:** Speak directly to the characters rather than the players controlling them.

**Explanation:** This technique enhances immersion by keeping everyone's focus on the fictional world rather than pulling them back to the real world.

**Example:** Instead of saying "George, what does Navika do?" say "Navika, what are you doing as you see the approaching guards?"

## 3. Embrace the Fantastic
**Description:** Introduce fantastical and extraordinary elements from the beginning of the campaign.

**Explanation:** Don't save the most exciting and magical aspects of your world for high-level play. Fantasy games should feel fantastical at every level of play.

**Example:** Even at level 1, let players discover an ancient artifact with growing powers, encounter a being from another plane, or witness a magical phenomenon that defies conventional understanding.

## 4. Make a Move That Follows
**Description:** Let the narrative flow naturally by following the logical next step based on character actions.

**Explanation:** Instead of sticking rigidly to pre-planned outcomes, respond to player choices with sensible consequences that honor their agency.

**Example:** When players decide to sneak into a castle rather than using their invitation, adapt by improvising guard patterns and potential complications rather than forcing them back to your original plan.

## 5. Never Speak the Name of Your Move
**Description:** Maintain the illusion of the game world by not referring to game mechanics in your narration.

**Explanation:** Breaking the fourth wall by discussing mechanics pulls players out of immersion and reveals the constructed nature of the experience.

**Example:** Rather than saying "The goblin makes an attack roll against you," describe how "The goblin lunges forward, blade gleaming in the torchlight as it aims for your midsection."

## 6. Give Every Monster Life
**Description:** Make creatures memorable by describing them using multiple senses, not just visual appearance.

**Explanation:** Multisensory descriptions create more vivid and memorable encounters that players will remember long after the session.

**Example:** Instead of just saying "There's a troll," describe "A hunched figure emerges from the cave, each labored breath releasing the stench of rotting meat. Its leathery skin scrapes against stone as rheumy yellow eyes fix on your position."

## 7. Name Every Person
**Description:** Give every NPC a specific name and identity, no matter how minor their role.

**Explanation:** Named characters feel more real and allow players to form attachments, making the world feel populated and alive.

**Example:** Rather than "the blacksmith" or "the guard," use specific names like "Tormund the one-eyed blacksmith" or "Guard Lienna, who's always chewing mint leaves."

## 8. Ask Questions, Use the Answers
**Description:** Involve players in worldbuilding by asking them questions and incorporating their ideas.

**Explanation:** This collaborative approach reduces GM prep burden, increases player investment, and creates unexpected story elements you might not have devised alone.

**Example:** When players enter a new town, ask "Jaron, your character has traveled here before - what's the strangest local custom everyone follows?" Then incorporate their answer into your world.

## 9. Be a Fan of the Characters
**Description:** Approach GMing as a supportive audience rather than an adversary.

**Explanation:** The game should not be GM versus players but a collaborative story where the GM genuinely wants to see how characters overcome challenges.

**Example:** When a player devises a creative solution to a trap, celebrate it rather than being disappointed they bypassed your challenge. Wonder with excitement what they'll do next rather than trying to "beat" them.

## 10. Think Dangerous
**Description:** Create a world with real stakes where anything can happen, including unexpected triumphs or defeats.

**Explanation:** Allow player actions to have meaningful impact even if it disrupts your planned storyline. Don't artificially protect your NPCs or plot points.

**Example:** If players devise a clever plan that could take down your main villain early, let it work if their execution deserves success, then adapt the story to the consequences of that unexpected development.

## 11. Begin and End with the Fiction
**Description:** Frame everything in terms of the story world, with mechanics serving only as tools to resolve uncertainty.

**Explanation:** The narrative is what players will remember, not the dice rolls. Rules should enhance the story experience, not dominate it.

**Example:** Start with describing the situation ("The ancient door is covered in strange runes that pulse with faint blue light"), move to mechanics if needed ("Roll Arcana to understand their meaning"), then return to fiction ("You recognize these as portal runes dating to the Age of Mist").

## 12. Think Off Screen Too
**Description:** Consider what's happening in the world beyond the players' immediate perception.

**Explanation:** The world should feel dynamic, with NPCs and factions pursuing their own agendas whether or not the players are present to witness them.

**Example:** After players humiliate a noble at court, don't just wait for them to interact with him again. Instead, have him hire assassins, spread rumors about the party, or forge alliances with their enemiesâ€”creating consequences that emerge naturally when they least expect it.

These principles combine to create a more immersive, responsive, and collaborative gaming experience that focuses on storytelling while reducing GM burnout.
